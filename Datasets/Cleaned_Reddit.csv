0,update i am probably getting back together with my old girlfriend from middle school tomorrow night and i have not been this happy in years spoiler alert she kissed me i am over the moon here is the situation if you did not see the first post alright so a few nights ago i invited my old girlfriend from middle school to come over to my place and watch movies we have been hanging out for the last few months getting to know eachother again and i am so so happy i have been considering seeing if she wanted to start dating again for months and i finally decided that i was just going to do it and see what happened i have a friend who i got to do some recon for me and he was 100 sure that she was just waiting for me to make a move so i was not nervous about her saying no or anything i was just hesitating because getting into a relationship with someone you really like is nervewracking and also probably because i have got some horrible problems with intimacy dab anyway my roommate was home so we spent some time playing board games together which was awesome but after a bit i texted her like hey need to hang out with this lady alone for a bit please let me have the living room and so she did and it was just her and me i made dinner which was awful because i am not a great cook and i meant for us to go out to eat somewhere but we both bike places so that was not realistic so we had a meal of very salty stir fry which she somehow managed to eat without complaining one time while we were eating we put on a movie we started the night on opposite sides of the couch but i being the subtle and suave woman of the world that i am got just a little bit closer to her every time i got up to refill my water which was a lot until eventually she called me out and said that i could just sit next to her if i wanted which i did so i did and i sort of nestled into the crook of her arm and she put her arm around me and i rested my head against her shoulder going to be honest folks coulda cried it is the most right i have felt in years probably the most right i have felt in oh something like eight years and three months since she moved away the first time it was like putting on glasses for the first time when you did not know how bad your eyesight had gotten i did not realize how much happiness i had not been feeling just being close to her like that again was such a rush but a weirdly calm rush like after you have been running for a long time and you finally get to flop down in the grass somewhere i felt so much stress that i would been holding on for years just melt gone and i did not even worry about what i was doing or if i was going too fast or if i looked stupid or anything like that i did not worry about her thinking it was weird that my hand was on her stomach or if i was being too affectionate i was able to just stop thinking and enjoy the moment feeling her breathing how soft her shirt was how great it felt to have someone hold me for the first time in ages and i was so relaxed and so content that the words just slipped out we should go out again did not fret about how i was going to phrase it or what she would think or how it would affect our friendship just said it and she did not say yes she fucking kissed me she put her hand on my cheek and leaned down and put her lips on my lips and she kissed me i wish i could say it was my first kiss because the other ones were really regrettable but it was my first kiss with her i remember how often i would stress about wanting to kiss her when we were alone together drawing comics in my room or watching tv or doing homework or whatever and i never did it and i always regretted not doing it and now we have done it and it was beautiful and fantastic and i am going to scream i cannot stop thinking about her i am smiling all the time my friends do not recognize me when i am not miserable every little thing about her just makes me grin like a loon she called me by the silly pet name that she had for me in middle school i did not know how much i missed that and she held my hand she kissed me at the door ahhh we get to hold hands in public and i can introduce her to people as my partner and we do not have to hide that we are dating anymore because we are adults and who cares what anyone thinks i do not remember the last time i was giddy like this and of course i am also terrified because i have spent a long time in therapy trying to learn how to be vulnerable with people and silence my brain when it says that my best friends are going to get shipped off to mexico at any moment so getting close to people is dangerous and i have been trying to learn how to develop feelings for other people since i obviously could not have a relationship with her because she was in yucatan for all i knew it feels regressive to date her again when i have made so much progress trying to get over losing her and i worry that i am romanticizing her i do not think i am at least not too badly but there is always the voice in the back of my head telling me that i only love this person because she used to be my middle school girlfriend we are both totally different people now and i am worried that my brain is just settling into this relationship because i want those eight years back with the girl i knew and i want her parents to like me i mean they do like me but i want them to like me as her girlfriend i want them to approve of me as a partner apparently she is out to her dad which surprises me a little but he always seemed like he might be cool her mom still does not know she is very religious but my girlfriend ahhhh says that she is trying to get better about lgbt stuff since pope francis is cool with it so maybe there is a chance anyway i am dying over here thank you to everyone who wanted an update on this story if anybody just wants to hear me gush some more feel free to reach out via dms my profile is a kinky mess alt account for lonely nights so please ignore any nsfw stuff you see i have so much stuff that i want to talk about and my friends are all tired of hearing about it although they are happy that there is an update and that things are going well so do not hesitate to reach out
0,despite all downfalls and against everything i could not be happier with how things are going happy with myself and how lucky i am to date the man of my dreams super new to reddit but in all honesty i read this reddit as often as i do my religious studies and after seeing everyone share their joy never fails to make me smile so i want to share mine as well by the way i am not a native english so if sentences do not make sense you now know why i have known my now boyfriend ever since we were in middle school he met me during one of the hardest times of my life as a kid i found out i am incurably ill at a very young age not something that will be fatal on long term but quality of life is severely reduced as kids his company was one i enjoyed alot everytime in all my years of meeting people i have never consistently been able to enjoy someone is presence years pass we change i did not for the better for a long time stuff got to me and i got bitter which til this day i wish i realised how down bad i was i am still thinking about how i could have been better however we remained friends but through my act i made him feel not loved with my rough attitude one day i realised just how poorly i was doing and treating those around me because i got so bitter after alot of things happened i realised i did not want to be like this anymore and lost myself over the years i distanced myself from every thing stopped using my phone computer and consoles as a whole as i started to do some self reflection and learn alot of times passes i wrote down his info to pick up contact again after i bettered myself before i took a trip i promised him that when i am ready i would soon greet him again going back to people i once knew was harder than ever all i thought of was how people perceived me and how i was like before i saw in how i was i struggled contacting him but after months of contemplating i did it and i could not call him that man singlehandedly changed his phone number dammit so after contacting some other people who knew both of us they gave me his new info i messaged him scared whether he would accept me or not and to my suprise he did i explained to him everything that went on in my mind and how i look back on myself from that point on things improved even beyond what i thought being around him has made me learn even more and eventually i felt things were getting a bit awkward in a pinch and desperate effort i told him that i liked him alot and just needed to get it off my chest because the awkwardness that i felt i would be fine if he did not feel the same i knew what risk i would take because if he did not feel the same at all well we all know where that can go and he said he liked me back and that he always did ever since we were young i do not know how to transition from this point on in my writing but life has been so good we can talk about things i can be myself even if i am rather childish he always loves seeing me happy and doing what i want to do he appreciates the transparency of our relationship and that we can talk about every little thing that bothers us and it is okay we respect eachother and do not mock eachother we listen to each others feelings and improve from that point on even if he has odd passions i love them seeing his interest and pure joy he finds in a hobby i cannot help but smile i have had some confrontations with people who hate my guts rightfully so it is okay that they are mad and i understand it motivates me even more to better myself i have been invested in my roots languages and beliefs my health has hit a downfall and i cannot do much anymore i no longer work and had to take care of myself he is here to support me through it the path to recovery and getting my health back together will take a long ass time but hey atleast i am with a guy who told me he thought he was going to marry me when we were 10 the biggest lessons i have learned and i hope someone can learn from these as well respect and equal treatment is important you never know what someone is going through so never snap at someone because you have your own bad day consistent effort and showing you care builds long term bonds it is okay to be tired but be sure to talk about how you feel and those who really appreciate you will understand how you feel and last but not least perception do not work yourself up over something someone said if someone comes off rude i guarantee most of the time someone just worded it poorly and even if it was meant to hurt you teaching yourself how to perceive the world and things around you will make even such things will not affect you anymore you will feel more joy and your quality of life will significantly increase when you start to smile at strangers and see everything in a positive light the moment you start doing it it becomes natural and will only become a better and more dominant trait over time oh and do it for yourself make changes you want to change like investing in a subculture that is not socially desirable but you have always admired investing and developing interests will make you feel more confident i play drums but also love knitting sweaters and i am proud of these drastically different hobbies oh and really the last one tell them that you like them trust me on that one sorry i treated this like a diary entry but maybe someone enjoys reading it haha i still suck at writing a last reminder for those who need it know that you are loved surround yourself with people who make you feel loved and do not feel afraid to leave and start over again and you can finally start fresh it helps i am proud of you and you should be proud of yourself as well little steps always count up to something bigger
0,how i learnt how to love myself at the age of 15 i am not the problem i am strong and constantly growing as a person hi i am a 15 year old teenager who became introspective and selfaware about himself i am from a very unstable family when i was in 7th grade i had suicidal thoughts feelings that my problems would go on and on and will not stop hated myself but then i realized i had an ambition i always thought of saving somebody from suicide and changing the lives of others i always wanted to become a psychotherapist and write philosophical stuff theories on my personal diary of thoughts which i hide when i was in 7th8th grade i was kind of a people pleaser too nave tried to see the good in all repressed my anger in order to avoid conflicts did not know when things are going too far but then in 9th grade i realized that boundaries must be created my parents are not really good parents my mom is emotionally unstable very bossy sometimes gets mad randomly while my dad constantly invalidates my feelings and gaslights me i cannot get in therapy they think its useless both of them constantly fights there is no more understanding agreement between them my mom is very manipulative towards my dad threatens to leave us if she did not get what she want then my dad would get scared and follow anyways convinced them to get to family therapy did not work they think its a waste of time they never really understood that relationships could recover beautifully even if i told them that i told my dad the repressed anger and sadness i have been keeping for years ended up getting told to just accept it got invalidated i know that my parents are not perfect in raising me nobody is perfect someday in the future i will heal myself from this trauma and now i just have to endure that i am from a very dysfunctional family i usually just vent to my best friends or online i really want to move out and go to a university currently in grade 10 only 2 more years cannot really make new friends or go out due to the pandemic its very strict here so i just have to message or video call my previous friends that i trust i know that this will probably follow me through my adulthood due to the fact that i never really felt loved so i daydream every night about finding someone who would accept me for who i am understand me help me grow and mature as a person but then i realized i have myself i know that i am an amazing and a lovable person who deserves to be loved people have told me i am soft hearted open minded a great listener never invalidates intelligent and not a judgmental person i confirmed what they said because i finally know my mindset after allowing time for myself this is how i learnt how to love and know myself i identified the positive things about me in which i truly believe in regardless of what some people say i am soft hearted and kind because of my ambitions on becoming a psychotherapist helping people heal themselves save people i know i cannot save every person help the world but saving one would mean the world to them i know i am a great listener and open minded because i would often listen with an open mind and an open heart i do not invalidate because i believe that the person that can know you the most is yourself you should not just brush it off tell that there are many other problems i empathize i know i am not judgmental because i have this mindset where i view people like a spectrum between bad and good i believe everyone has flaws and it is up to us if we are going to accept them or not depending on the severity of their traits i know that every behavior has a reason so i should be open and know from their perspective sometimes people deserve to be forgiven but i usually do not talk to them afterwards but remove grudges 2nd i identified the negative traits about me and determined if i should improve it or accept it i know i am a person who can take a lot of personal stuff from people very giving too kind and nave but now i know that i have attracted a lot of toxic people i focused more on myself and decided to cut them all out and keep the ones who i feel like i can trust and are decent and genuinely wants me to be happy and okay i learnt that its better to have a few close friends than to have a lot of friends started realizing when i was in 8th grade improvement another thing i daydream a lot i can sometimes be very unaware of my surroundings which annoys my parents but i accept that it gives me insights about life makes me know more things deeply gives me encouragement and hope acceptance that is all i know for a fact this will follow me from adulthood but it would be my responsibility to heal myself i know that i have myself me and my friends may someday stop reconnecting but i know that i have and i love myself someday i hope to find the one who will love me help me for more improvement i do not know if i would forgive my parents because i realized that parents are not perfect in raising a child i just have to focus on endurance acceptance and maturity for 2 more years
0,how to be happy instead of miserable when you become 60 millions of us call happiness their lifelong goal but few define what happiness means often leading us to chase what our parents friends and role models defined as happiness so when we are back to wearing diapers we realize we ignored everything we genuinely esteemed in my experience studying dozens of happiness frameworks and sciencebacked studies about happiness i have found the best chance at being happy at any time comes from defining what happiness is not it is like an inverse happiness checklist in it you write what does not bring you joy and then ensure your current pursuit of happiness whether it is to travel the world or become wealthy does not include any of the items from the checklist the inverse checklist serves two purposes it helps define happiness and tells you which activities to remove from your life so for example if you conclude money does not bring joy but you work from 99 because hustle is life then reduce the number of say side projects you have otherwise you will be frustrated after reaching financial freedom and likely feelphysically and mentally exhausted each persons definition of happiness varies however most people can include specific items into their inverse checklist to define happiness your definition of happiness cannot reject distress we cannot control the decisions and behaviors of humans animals or nature otherwise hurricanes and phone thieves would not exist so no matter the statistical formula you use to predict events or the number of possible scenarios you draw on your whiteboard potential sources of unhappiness are always around the corner to avoid the discomfort from harmful events some people write a list of sources of distress and eliminate them from their life for example they quit their job to run from their nerveracking boss or switch majors the issue with this list is its potential sizeit is infinite because any event in our lives can distress us a more efficient solution is to invite distress into your life and realizing happiness can coexist with events that do not match our definition of a perfect activity day or life for example a harmless event like microsoft word crashing before letting you save an article could either ruin your day or it could become a fun challenge to overcome when you welcome distress you experience two benefits first you become used to different causes of discomfort reducing their chances of affecting you second you realize distress can and must coexist with happiness your definition of happiness cannot come from others most of us chase a definition of happiness that other people set for us leading to repentance during our deathbed for example some people accumulate academic titles to impress their parents while others seek minimalism according to a monks advice in college psychologists doctors and nurses taught me around 80 of older people underpalliative careregretted their lives choices but you do not need wrinkles or to be in a hospital to regret your life so instead change it today first write down a list of scenarios that would bring happiness to your life you can then describe the benefits of each scenario and the barriers between you and them second answer the most crucial question who is someone in my life who believes this scenario would bring happiness ask yourself one last question is this goal worth pursuing even though x person shares it contrast your answer with other items from your checklist so if you think happiness is living amongst your friends in the countryside goal your friends feel the same influence but your inverse checklist says youdo notlike being away from the city then stop pursuing that goal avoid being miserable on your deathbed while your dna differs from the millions of people who have regretted their lifes choices on their deathbeds you may be following another persons definition of happinessjust like they did unfortunately the old and sick do not have the strength to change their lives drastically but you do so start developing today a definition of happiness your elderly self will accept oneyoutruly believe share one item you would add to your inverse happiness checklist below if you are not comfortable doing it publicly please dm me on twitter at mrnicolasforero i am curious to discover what you would add
0,the day i truly felt like i became a dad so to offer some background i took up the responsibility of becoming a single parent last year i had contemplated taking in an older kid not only because i thought i could at least leave them alone during the day when i was at work but also because i knew how often older kids get passed up in the system for babies toddlers and young kids and after getting in touch with my agency i eventually found out about a kid that was actually my neighbor at one point having lived in the same apartment building as me she lived three doors down from me and i remember chatting with her casually a few times because she would just hang out outside her apartment every day i had no idea she was the victim of abuse from her mother and felt terrible i remember the day her social worker introduced me to her i had to remind her of our interactions and once she remembered she had the biggest smile on her face once i took her in and i spent the first week home with her it went fairly well there were some bad habits i had to help break like she used to swear casually just thought it was normal and some other small things but we got over it over the proceeding months and she is been good ever since i trust and love her and she trusts and loves me so the event in question happened about two months ago i was going to be gone for a business trip for about three weeks and had to leave my daughter with my brother and my niece and nephew she did not mind staying with them but was understandably upset at the idea of me being gone for so long she was not having a breakdown or anything just kind of forlorn and sullen it broke my heart seeing her like that but i made sure to make our last night together as memorable as possible and stayed up way later than i should have just for her sake the next morning i left and it took every fiber of my being to step outside and leave but somehow i did i kept in touch with her and my sister regularly just to make sure everything was going well needless to say i hated being gone and wanted nothing more than to hop back in my car and go home the thing i left for was so needlessly boring and tedious beyond imagining i mean sure i liked being with my coworkers and meeting new people but i would rather be elsewhere of course somehow i got through it though and woke up extremely early the next morning and put petal to the metal to get home do not worry i slept enough and was not tired while driving or anything like that it was like something out of a hallmark movie because when i got to my brothers she literally burst out of the front door and jumped into my arms nearly knocking me over she acts like i just came home from war or something i said to my brother and all three of us laughed this was the moment i truly felt like a dad because i was just so in the moment for once in my life and did not think about anything else except her and me it is that thing where we just look at each other and smile not saying anything and we just know how much we care about each other we touched our heads and even i felt myself cry a little bit that day in particular was the day for me and it mad me realize that for me the hardest thing about being a parent so far is not having to deal with her bad days or stuff at school or any of that it is knowing i cannot always be around 247 yes she has my brother and other family to count on for support and is close with all of them but the idea of her being gone one day and off to college or wherever she goes frightens me a bit i know it should not but it does nevertheless i try to focus on the here and now as much as i can and do anything and everything for her if i really had to do it all over again i would have gotten her out of that place and away from her mom much sooner
0,my world is so much fuller with people who love me than i could have ever expected bonus pic of adorable dog included a few days ago in a moment of crisis i nearly made a permanent choice to a temporary situation it is so strange to think about now i did not even recognize who i was was at the time it was practically an out of body experience the one person who i had thought would always have my back if i ever found myself in this situation could not help me and was not able to for a few reasons anyhow for the last year or so i have largely viewed myself as being alone on this spinning rock of seven billion people and i sure as hell was convinced of it at the moment one call with someone i had not talked to in nearly half a year stopped me from committing the irreversible from that moment on and since then there has been someone there for me to support me first there was my younger sister who i have had a strained relationship the past few years she told me she loved me and has been talking messaging me since an aunt who i never in a million years would have expected to care came and got me her with two of her friends on vacation talked with me listened for hours to everything i had to say they fed me gave me clarity on a lot and supported me in ways i never would have expected from anyone the aunt gave me her number and told me to message her if i ever needed anything my dad has been calling me almost every day and he said he would be there in any way i needed him to my mom hugged me and we cried she too has been giving me a lot of advice and talking to me about a lot of things beyond them so many other people as well have reached out to me business associates old friends family distant and close and even acquaintances my email and phones have had so many notifications from all of them it is blown my mind how many people care about my well being the past few years i have focused so much of my time and energy into building my profession and businesses traveling putting my love for what i do above everything else even my own well being and time spent with others it got to the point where everyone around me was just like a blimp in the past paced rhythm of my life i had met a girl and she was the only constant for most of the last nine months there are so many things i would have missed out on if it had not been for the support i received and it is been weighing heavily on my mind i would not have been able to pet my cat or take my dog on another walk my family would have been devastated i would have never able again to watch another sunset or feel the wind on my skin while driving with the windows down i would have never been able to get a second masters degree take another great picture i am a pro photog travel any more or meet any more terrific people i would have never gotten to buy a house settle down meet and marry a wife one day or even have kids i am just so glad i am still here still alive rumi said the would is the place where the light enters and now i can see that so clearly i never knew or imagined i mattered so much to so many people i have so much relief that i am still here still alive you really never know who will actually be there to support you when push comes to shove even now i am just looking out the window as i write this looking at the ocean and the clouds and i am realizing how beautiful of a day it is i am truly am grateful to be apart of it i am committed now to bettering myself in my deficits am getting the help i need and i am going to make the most of this opportunity to still be here i will not make the same near mistake again also for the hell of it here is a bonus video of my beloved dog i hope all of you are doing well and are okay reddit have a beautiful day
0,i am probably getting back together with my old girlfriend from middle school tomorrow night and i have not been this happy in years my friends are so tired of hearing me gush about this but i cannot stop talking about it so i am coming to reddit instead so way back in middle school i was dating this girl and that is the happiest i have ever been she was my absolute best friend ever since first grade and by the time we were twelve we were girlfriends none of our parents would have been okay with that heck my parents did not even like me being friends with a mexican girl so even though all i wanted to do was tell everyone how amazingly in love i was we had to keep it to ourselves i still have vivid memories of how good it felt to lay with my head on her lap and let her stroke my hair while we watched tv in my room or spending too much time together in the school library making fun of the grownup books for being boring or all the awkward tense beautiful moments when we were alone and i was trying to figure out if now was a good time to kiss her which of course it never was she was my absolute best friend still is and i know it is not healthy but i have always compared every relationship i have ever had to her not that i have had many anyway halfway through seventh grade she was gone her family moved to mexico because her grandpa in yucatan was getting older and needed her mom to come back and take care of him we had about a months worth of notice before she was just out of my life and to this day i do not think i ever really got over it my parents would not let me have a cell phone or social media or anything until i turned sixteen so staying in contact was hard and eventually we just stopped fell out of touch and i was not okay for a really long time i could not have another relationship with a girl because my brain kept telling me she was going to disappear on me i tried liking guys because it was easier in a lot of ways but i am definitely not straight so that was not happening i wound up falling into a pretty bad depression that i am still not out of but therapy and medication have made things a lot better then six months ago we ran into eachother again totally by happenstance turns out we both wound up going to the same college even though it is about a thousand miles away from where we grew up we have been living in the same town for almost three years and we did not even know she had classes with a friend of mine and he would talk about her to me and i never even considered that the girl he was talking about could maybe be the same girl i grew up with i saw them leaving class together one day and even then i did not know she recognized me though the look of absolute shock on her face god and the way she hugged me so tight when i was just frozen there i was always worried that she did not miss me as much as i missed her and even though i think she dealt with it a lot better than i did i know that is not true now we have spent the last six months catching up and becoming friends again and i am on top of the moon i actually have not been this happy in years and tomorrow night i am going to ask her to go out with me again and of course i am terrified but i know she is going to say yes i am so excited i could scream and i can actually tell people now i can hold hands with her while walking down the street i can rest my head on her shoulder while sitting on a park bench we can get married if we want to god i could talk about this for hours and hours and hours so if anybody wants to dm me and talk some more i definitely would not complain either way i hope my happiness made you guys a little happier today update she kissed me you all i have got a girlfriend and i am freaking out
0,the night i had my first kiss ever and everything leading up to it so as i have said before in other posts on other subreddits i have a very close group of friends that i have known since kindergarten and first grade they are like my own little family and i do not know where i would be without them but out of all them the one who i have known the longest aside from my best friend is my now boyfriend he first asked me out to our end of year school dance for our graduating class about a month before it happened i thought at first he just wanted me as his date which i was totally down with but then he kind of sorta implied he wanted to actually take me on a date sometime i was a mixture of confused and full of butterflies i did not even really have feelings for him at the time sure he is one of the people i trust most in my life and who has always been there for me when i needed him and sure i would always found him cute and kind of goofy but i never found myself liking him like that but seeing how nervous he was just trying to ask me out made me realize how much he must have cared about me and made me feel special so my dad and even my stepmomtobe they are engaged took me dress shopping and the night of she did my hair for me i cannot really describe how i felt looking at myself in the mirror but it was like i did not recognize the person in it i never put this much effort into my appearance before and could not believe it was me i did not cry or anything but i did think about my mom and realized how much i looked like her especially with how i had my hair done even my dad said that i guess just by pure coincidence the way my hair was done was how my mom looked on their first date so we got to the dance and of course all my friends were there as well all of them complimenting each other on their appearances but as soon as i walked in they all turned their heads and made me feel even more angelic the night went on and we all just loved being in each others company and could not believe we were all about to start high school soon but then of course the slow dance came up andwell needless to say neither of us knew what we were doing and had to look at everyone else lol on top of being this close to him even just him having his hands on me and the way we were both smiling at each other it was here when he really told me how he felt about me no i love you or anything like that but just him telling me the things he was feeling how beautiful i looked how long he would had feelings for me all that stuff i myself was at a loss for words hearing someone talk or even care enough about me to say these things i almost thought this was all a dream and was not really happening so overcome with so many emotions but then out of nowhere something inside me just said to go for it and i kissed him he looked at me like i had two heads and we both laughed and we kissed again after the song ended even just writing this has gotten me excited lol this was back in may and we are officially dating now we have also since said we love each other and honestly i am probably the happiest i have ever been my daddy of course says he does not like him but i know he is not 100 serious he is usually let him come over to the house or let me go to his i also love how we have completely different personalities and interests yet cannot stand being apart for long he is always been quiet and introverted but i am usually outgoing and love talking to people if i had to point out one thing i love about him most it would probably be his laugh because he is usually so quiet when he laughs or even chuckles it takes me by surprise every time but that is all i felt like sharing for now thanks for reading
0,initiated a fun conversation with a stranger and overcame a fitness fear i am feeling really good as i am writing this i am genuinely proud of how i handled myself these past two days in two separate situations trying to get over a bit of a slump so i forced myself to go on more walks around the city and parks to hit 10000 steps every day it is been a really fun atmosphere around the city this weekend because we have the arts festival and pride celebrations both going on in pittsburgh right now yesterday i saw a cute girl sitting by herself and after reminding myself regret is worse than rejection i went over and started a conversation with her the chat was entertaining easy light we learned a bit about eachother and got to have a simple pleasant conversation with hundreds of people walking around the park near us this was the first time i have approached a girl to talk since my 4 year relationship ended when she and i had to head our separate ways to get to work after about 30 minutes i scribbled my number down on a piece of paper and gave it to her it is been well over a day now and she has not contacted me and at this point i am guessing probably will not but that is okay i am still incredibly happy that i proved to myself i can still engage in a conversation with a stranger and have the confidence to go start a chat and handle myself throughout please do not interpret this as a silver lining sort of thing because it is completely fine if we never talk again i am happy about the fact i shut up all those negative worried voices and just walked up to someone and said hi that is a win for me then this afternoon i was feeling really good after my workout and had just got my new running shoes in the mail that morning so i wanted to go for a short run to try them out i have always been self conscious about my weird abb genetics mine do not line up nicely across from one another and i have some light remnants of bacne from when i was a teenager 25 now it is 90 degrees full sun in the city right now so i rode that happiness i was still feeling from the previous day lathered up in sunscreen and went for my first run ever without my shirt on i ran along the water and ended up at point park and then walked home to recover through the arts festival and into the city while i was walking home some guy in a white truck was yelling hey buddy buddy buddy buddy out of his window until i turned to look at him in case i something had fallen out of my pocket or he was needing directions at which point he shouted put a shirt on and drove off i smiled so hard and i have felt amazing since then that would have destroyed me like hearing chicken legs when i was a ball boy for the soccer team at 13 but now it was the best compliment i could have gotten this jealous turd was so uncomfortable with where he is at physically that he felt the need to get my attention and try to shame me i felt wonderful i know i have my flaws but i also know i look pretty decent and it was really validating again this is not something bad where i am seeing the silver lining but a genuine sign that i have really grown and can handle that with the knowledge that i look good and i am doing well it realllllllly also showed me the truth of that notion that if you have already had a success of some sort early in your day hardships later sluff off more easily i knew i already crushed chest and calves that morning and had a good run so i could take this on the cheek all in all it is also been a fantastic example that happiness can compound and you can use each little nugget to fuel you on to do something else i am going to keep going and try to work on getting that every day cheers
0,my stepmom and stepbrother finally moved in with me and my dad today we are officially a complete family now sorry if i do not sound overly excited in the title lol it is a lot to take in and it is been a long day and especially a long week to get you all up to speed or feel free to read my previous posts from the beginning my dad has raised me pretty much all on his own from the beginning since my mom died giving birth to me he is basically the center of my world and who i love more than anything sure i have my boyfriend whom i also love to bits and he also makes me feel appreciated and cherished but me and my dad is something else and i do not know how i got so lucky to have him in my life that all being said though he started seeing a woman two years ago they went to high school and graduated together and reconnected through friends she is honestly made him happier than i have ever seen him a different kind of happy if that makes sense but she my stepmom has been through a lot also her then husband walked out on her and their son at some point and left her a single mom he would occasionally get in contact with her but as she described him he is the kind who just takes and takes and never gives she never said he abused them just that he was not a very good person but the biggest thing that is made me at least respect and like her is how she treats me from literally the first day she came to our house for dinner she saw me as her own she saw me and just said hi sweetheart and hugged me looking at me with the biggest smile on her face it was an odd feeling because i just never really felt any sort of motherly love like this before but fast forward to now and they have both finally moved in with me and my dad as of today the past two weeks have mostly been spent moving stuff over to our place little by little me and my dad went over to her place to get what was left i would only been to her house a few times before and always liked it even though it was rather small one floor actually it was weird seeing it so empty and barren and it was especially hard for her to leave it all behind she stood at the front door for almost two minutes before finally having the strength to close it for good and even then the hard part was not over she said goodbye to all her neighbors who were waiting for her and even my stepbrother had to say bye to his friends that honestly got to me a little bit seeing all of them crying but somehow we got through it and went home my stepmom holding my hand the whole way there and that is about all i feel like sharing for now though some of you are probably wondering if i love her my stepmom and honestly i do i respect and care about her deeply like everyone else in my life and am beyond happy to have her so happy that now i cannot imagine being without her i really mean that but i do not know if i am ready to call her mom yet i had one and i know i love her even though i never met her it is complicated and i am sorry if i make it sound that way but hey i am happy and everyone is happy and that is what is important technically she is not my stepmom yet since they have not gotten married but you get the idea my dad has also already framed a photo of him and her that they took in the living room where he is hugging her from behind and they each have the biggest smiles on their faces it is beautiful i know my stepbrother is kind of iffy about the whole situation also but already likes my dad and i think the two of them are going to become quite close if i think of any more details to add in i will try and edit this when i get the chance thanks for reading
0,we finally said i love you to each other and it felt so cathartic me and my boyfriend started out as a long distance situation started talking last september he flew to meet me in december and i moved back to the country he is from back in may that is when we started living together he always went the extra mile for me and i tried to do the same for him but until couple weeks ago we never said i love you to each other so couple weeks ago we had a fight nothing crazy not our first one once we resolve things we usually cuddle and just give each other affection helps to let go of all the negative things accordingly after this argument he was holding me then he just squeezed me and told me he loved me i got flustered so i responded with a squeeze back and an aww quickly followed by i love you too my mind was racing he said it so casually and out of nowhere i thought that first i love you must not be of equal importance to him as it is to me and in the moment i assumed that since we were already calling each other my love he probably thought he had already confessed his love for me nevertheless i was happy around a week goes by we go to visit his dad for a couple days it was my first time meeting him so quite a bit of anxiety day 1 goes great lots of good food great conversation and a lot of booze so by the end of the night i am in my feelings once we hit the hay i hug my boyfriend and tell him that i love him he squeezes me real tight and for much longer than he usually would so i ask what is up he says well it is the first time you said you loved me to skip the most of the following conversation he did not hear me whisper the i love you too to him when he told me he loved me he was very nervous to say it in the first place and then thought i did not say it back according to him he was happy to wait until i was ready to say it back since i gave a very positive response but knowing him i am 99 sure it was torturous for him to think we were not on the same level i am so glad i said it that night i do not find it easy to tell people i love them a bit of an avoidant attachment style going on there yet it felt so good it felt good to just say it and it felt good to be able to tell him that i did say it back that day it felt good to show him that his feelings were reciprocated and appreciated and to tell him that i was waiting for a long time to either say it or hear him say it having had a difficult childhood and adolescence where me displaying vulnerability and emotional pain was greeted by indifference and dismissals nowadays i still find it challenging to be vulnerable despite having worked out most of my other issues i have learned to depend on myself and only myself on pretty much all levels and saying i love you implies that to a certain degree i am willing to depend on and be attached to that person it is not my first relationship and not my first time saying i love you but for the first time it does not feel like an unhealthy addiction or a rushed decision i waited we waited and i am more comfortable in my vulnerability than i have ever been he is more appreciative of my vulnerability than most people i have considered family friends or lovers and i am very appreciative of his i am happy
0,kind of finally getting the thai teenager experience ummm so i am not sure what to put in the title because it is kind of complicated but i guess what i said works just a warning that this going to be a long post also lol lately i have been making so many new friends local friends i did not have a lot of local friends previously people from my country as i has to cut off people from my old school and now i am not inside my countrys education system either most of my friends are overseas my bestfriends are almost 13000 miles away i have always wanted to have people i could go hangout with people with the same timezone to hangout with people to talk about shit going on here not ones that i am just explaining the whole situation to but one that shares an experience i have first met this friend through a facebook group i had a post that went viral and he added me he then commissioned my art i then found out we are the same age and like a lot of things in common i was really happy to have a new local friend he also let me send him happy mail and i made him a rick roll card then i joined his discord server and got to meet his classmates his friends are really nice to me so we soon became friends too i send them happy mail i help them cheat on their online exams and their english homework we have now talked about maybe hanging out at the amusement park when covid gets better my friend says that i am like the unofficial 46th student of their class because of how much i interact with everyone i feel so accepted its so nice then i met my friends other friend it was actually just a day ago we hung out and talked on call and it was so fun i asked if i could send him mail too and he was really enthusiastic and told me i can send as much as i want and he will keep a collection then this new friend introduced me to his gf and she is likes stationery she was so excited when i told her i do snail mail she said she had never done it before and would love to write with me i was really scared that i would somehow not be able to hangout with these people because of what happened in the past but now i am literally doing nothing but being myself and i am making so many friends i just feel so fucking happy right now i am making so many new friends i will get to use thai language more i could probably even hangout with them in my country now they actually all live in a different province from me so it is not like i can see them all the time but it is not super difficult to meet them either i am so excited i feel like i am finally getting the chance to experience a life of a teenager in thailand i thought i would not have a chance as i am about to not be a teenage very soon i have voice calls and video calls to be in all day like i have always dreamed of people are enthusiastic at what i do and i do not have to only care about what they like it makes me feel so fucking full inside i am bursting with joy i know this post was quite long and i maybe did not even make that much sense but thank you so much for listening to me also if anyone wants to know what happened about my old friends i can tell you but only via a letter lol i just really like to write letters so i had to say that lmao
0,i have the greatest best friend i could have ever asked for and she truly saved me from myself and from the crowd i used to hang out with i used to hang around the wrong crowd just not good people and they where not good people for multiple reasons but to break it down they did drugs and drank alcohol and used women for sex and ect and i used to find that crowd fun to hang out with and i used to find them cool and i myself was not a good person either but one day i met an extremely kind and decent person and we talked to eachother and became friends we had become good friends and i told her about some of my old crowds crap i did not like while i was friends with them when i should not have liked any of it and she did not like the stuff i told her they did and eventually me and her got closer because i wanted us to become closer friends and i eventually began to see that nothing my old friends where doing was okay at all and i saw how bad i myself was because of her i realized that i was not a good person and neither where my old friends so i was still friends with them for abit there and one of them made fun of someone for taking their life and others did other crap and eventually i finally pushed the old crowd out of my life for good and i became a truly good person all because of her we are now best friends and she is the most incredibly wonderful person i have ever and will ever meet and the greatest and most decent person i have ever met and will ever meet and i am living a very healthy and happy and joyful life all because of her simply knowing her made me turn into a good person and me and her hang out and enjoy being around eachother and she will always be my one and only best friend because of what she did for me and because of how she helped me so so much she means the world to me and i love her like family like a sister and i could never ask for a better best friend or be more grateful that she is in my life now and i am extremely protective over her i have met other good people through her who are my friends now including her boyfriend who is also one of the greatest people i have ever and will ever meet and me and him are amazing friends and i am just thankful and blessed she is here for me and that she is in my life we always get along and we agree on literally almost everything and we have the same morals and we both respect eahcother extremely and if it was not for her i do not know where i would be or who i would be hanging out with right now she gave me the courage to stand up to my adoptive dad who i do not want in my life and she is been here for me for everytime and i am always there for her and i make sure to be the greatest best friend i can be to and for her i just wanted to express this somwhere have a nice day good people

0,every cell in the human body emits a unique frequency and your brain puts out a frequency which can be picked up by other brains it can pass through anything because it basically is the same frequency type that a radio transmitter puts out the frequency that you are transmitting from your brain is smaller but it has a unique characteristic unlike radio frequencies which is that the frequency that your brain transmits can instantaneously travel faster than the speed of light and if transmitted can be picked up the exact same moment by another human brain on the opposite end of the planet energy and frequency are the same everything on planet earth emits a different frequency a frequency is also called a vibration it is also called energy it is quantifiable and it is measurable every atom emits a frequency your dna at the lowest level emits a unique frequency so your brain is a receiver and a transmitter a frequency that is the first concept and the second concept is the law of attraction which says whatever frequency you emit that exact same frequency is drawn to you there will be a magnetic pull and this is a scriptural principle for those of you who are christians jewish muslims hindus or buddhists all these books teach very similar concepts what you sow also you reap when you put out a frequency the law of attraction says it must come back law of attraction says by magnetic pull that has to bring that exact same frequency back which is based on whatever vibration you put out whatever frequency that your brain emotions body and electromagnetic field puts out it will attract and it will defy any physical law selfinduced goosebumps from positive stimulis allows you to take 100 control of your transmitter by vibrating different parts of your body and is also able to as a gentle euphoric vibrating wave travels underneath your skin sometimes cold and other times hot vibrate your whole physical body when doing so you consciously activate your physical and spiritual body to attract whatever intention narrative thought and emotions that are present when consciously summoning your selfinduced goosebumps goosebumps is just the physical reaction but underneath it there is a real vibrating wave that can be looked at as energy i have found many names for this energy like spiritual chills euphoria voluntary goosebumps ecstasy prana chi qi vayus aura mana life force pit rapture ruah ether nephesch chills frissons the force and many more if you would like to know how to activate at will fully control your spiritual chills and how its an important ingredient to the law of attraction here is a five minute video explaining just that youtube video
0,my friend is being released from the psychiatric hospital tomorrow almost a month ago an old friend of mine went through a suicidal breakdown and he called me out of the blue for help after two years of no contact his family is hmong and they have very traditional gender roles he did not know who else to talk to so he just called me he used to be my best friend in junior college and when he told me everything that was going on i drove four hours from where i was in the middle of the night to come get him and take him to the er and his family this happened the day before my partner and i broke up and she was in a psychiatric hospital herself my dad was also having some issues with his heart and i had been dealing with my own issues it was an absurdly tough period the last time i had seen him in person something very similar to this had happened and he had not spoke to me once since then until this particular night except to ask for a job reference the last time he would been on the edge i had told him he could always ask me for help and i would always be there for him in the moment of as he explained what was going on it was all i could think about and i decided i was going to do my best to honor that commitment he ended up being admitted to a local hospital and i have stayed in contact with him since we have caught up on a lot and he explained why he cut contact the way he did the reasons are understandable and things got pretty emotional when he apologized thing is this was my dude when we were in school and no matter how much our friendship ending hurt when it did being human is an imperfect experience we fuck up we make mistakes i have made so many in my life more than i can count i have come to believe it is not making mistakes that matters it is how you respond and react to them resentment and hate are also such chaining and corrupting emotions there is so much freedom in forgiveness and i know all too well what it is like to feel alone finally he is being released tomorrow i am so freaking excited for him i am so glad he is still here on this spinning rock i am so happy he is going to be okay i am flying down from washington later today to spend some time with him i have been living through the most insane periods of my life and this one of the silver linings of it all more than anything i am just glad that when he called as piss poor as the timing was that i was able to just help and that i have my friend back again so often i am on the road for work and i would have been too far away to really be of any assistance i do not know how i would have responded had something else had happened i have seen too many people in my life for young in the past few years
0,just a release of stuff i have been dealing with so a little under 3 months ago i renewed my lease with my roommate then about 2 months ago my roommate told me that i he planned on moving out with his bf some time so that i should keep an eye out for a new roommate i assumed he meant for after our current lease was up about a month ago i found out he is going to be moving out real soon and that they had been searching for and shortly after found a house to get together if i absolutely have to i can budget super hardcore and carry out to the end of the lease on this 2 bedroom apartment on my own but i am searching for a roommate because i would prefer not to have to use an entire paycheck on just my apt bills my best option would be to find a roommate my second best would be to take an offer my apt complex gave me to move into a 1 bedroom here and carry out to the end of the lease without any extra cost other than rent adjustment the issue with this is my current rent is about 440 after being split with a roommate if i moved to a 1 bedroom my rent would be about 730 entirely on my own plus electricity wifi etc added on top of that my 3rd best option would be to move out end the lease early and find a 1 bedroom somewhere else the issue with this is that we would have to give 60 days notice plus 2 months rent so 4 months total for ending the lease early not to mention the cost of starting over at a new place and all that comes with that and unless i found a place and got approved very soon i would be most likely moving in november in nebraska where weather is a roll of the dice with disadvantage at the best of times i have had no luck with finding a new roommate and all of this is causing me a lot of stress my current roommate is a good dude and is kind of trying to help out but i do not think he thought this through most of my time lately is searching for any other options or any potential roommates but none are coming to me on top of that i have a financial meeting in the next few days to discuss long term savings plans and a bunch of other stuff that i am not entirely prepared for so i have to cram getting all of that ready in a very short amount of time because the stress of all the above made me forget about the meeting until just a few days ago i am trying to not have a breakdown about everything but shits hard most of my time when not working at my job or on the above is spent sleeping as a way to try and escape the stress of it all for even a few hours which is more difficult lately because of said stress if you read this thanks for taking the time i just needed to get some shit out into the void of the world
0,friends make all the difference in the world i have said this on another post i made a few hours ago i moved a lot growing up across multiple states and different houses and apartments i got to see a lot of cool things and meet interesting people but it was killer on the friendships it is hard to meet someone and establish yourself as being worthy of keeping in touch in such a short time naturally people ebb and flow in and out of your life always will but it definitely affected the way i look at building meaningful connections and how i interact with those bonds everything was very temporary for a long time earlier i was in such a bad state i am going through a breakup it was seven years and i met her when i was nineteen i had not eaten in two days and i think i might have been dehydrated from my medication i just was not paying attention because i was so utterly empty emotionally very tricky time my mom found me passed out because i slept all day probably from just not noticing how i was treating my body and it decided to have a little revolt anyway my mom made me some food and she just hugged me and i felt comforted warmth really warm it was remarkable that at twenty six years old i felt as much as i did from that simple long hug i ate my food and just sat with her blearily waking up from my stupor i was really groggy and had a hard time thinking properly it was like sleeping the deepest of sleeps and waking up from it abruptly we talked about how i was feeling and i just was content to be sad in her presense for awhile it helped in a way i told her later how grateful i was for her she is a good mom i go downstairs i cannot even remember why i think i just wanted to move and i get a phone call from a coworker who helped me call off earlier that morning because i was feeling particularly not well today and so i picked up you guys i am very lucky to have the people in my life that i do i have never had something like this before the people i work with are the most charming sincere kind and loving people they came and got me thirty minutes away took me to a bar fed me and got me drunk and i could not stop laughing i could not stop smiling i am feeling fuzzy from my head to my toes i just got dropped off at home things are going to get better and it is moments like these where as low as i am people have a way of being able to lift you right on out of that no problem i am still very sad i am not ready yet but one day maybe with time i will be until then i will just practice love your friends cherish them deeply same for your family sometimes they are all you need
0,why do we need to find out who we are and be happy journeying through this life we find ourselves arriving into places that trigger us to become who we really are these places bring experiences thoughts and emotions inside ourselves that become our mirror but unfortunately these experiences often reveal themselves as traumas highlevel stress chronic diseases or powerful shocks that usually make us feel disempowered and weak and most of all they make us feel the victims of this world since childhood we are usually taught that our external environment has the most powerful impact on our lives we are told to be competitive to be smart to win over every time insist as far as possible and earn as much as we can society shows us constraint guilt and limits in all areas it teaches us about the power outside of us which we are taught to own to accumulate as much as possible to keep it and not share it so that we will not lose it in this process of being educated by society we lose ourselves forget who we are and lose all connection to our future and our most desired path we lose connection with our passion and enthusiasm with our true ability to love and we forget about our potential here on earth it is like massive amnesia at a planetary level that keeps repeating for ages and millennia and waking up seems so hard deep inside during these painful experiences we start to pine for a better life for an amazing us inside for grandness and happiness and for living from our true inner self but deep inside we all know there is much more to life than having a job working a lot having 23 vacations a year and then succumb at one point after we repeat the same experiences the same thoughts and emotions actually there is no need to find ourselves we do not have to do anything but if we want to live life to the fullest and feel elevated emotions like love true compassion joy and fulfillment we have to decide do we want to live as the persona molded by society outside us or do we want to live as the most honest and powerful self liberated by our own light and power within what is there to lose what is there to win from where i am standing after more than 10 years of searching and questioning everything we never lose anything but we can win the most gracious gift of all the gift of being a creator and the freedom to live a life beyond our wildest dreams
0,as of an hour ago me and my wife are on our final step to fully adopting our kid all that is left now is a court hearing we are so excited i will try and keep this short and sweet it is been six months since we took in our girl and almost from the outset we had every intention of fully adopting her sure me and her had our differences mainly because of me and bottling up my emotions over a tragedy we suffered years prior but i have started seeing her as my daughter now and we are closer than ever during this time we have had visits from our agency that come and conduct wellness checks on both the living conditions of the house and also to see how we are doing especially her and every time it is gone smoothly and perfectly at least for their requirements so we had another visit from them today and this was what we anticipated most it was just more paperwork to be submitted to the court as well as an official petition to adoption that we needed to finally complete while me and my wife were doing this though one of the other agents sat with our daughter privately to just talk and ask how things were going if she genuinely wanted to stay with us anything bad that was happening that we were not telling them etc and at the end they brought her back in and said that now all that is left is for them to submit everything to the court for a judge to review they said that hopefully we should expect a response within 30 days but oftentimes it is sooner depending on how clean the background check is and a few other things we are almost there she our agent said it is funny because our daughter while she was extremely happy with how everything was going was not nearly as filled with joy as me and my wife were my wife was actually crying and could not contain herself she nearly smothered her in her arms giving her a bear hug i hugged her too and just looked her dead in the eyes and said we are almost there baby girl before kissing her forehead i mean i just do not know what to say or how to say it at this point this is like a dream come true with everything we have lost but also have gained so much more in the process it breaks my heart thinking about how many other kids her age or around it she is 14 are out there but will never have a permanent home like she will but i try not to think about it and am just thankful we have a kid as perfect as her in our lives

0,i am obsessed with him and it is making me sick 23 female there is this person mark davis 47 m i have been fixated on since around 2015 it is like when i saw him there was this instant interestbond ever since it is like i have to learn everything about him even the most minute detail like his favorite color what his medical history is details about his job prison warden his political views birthday december 25th everything and they are quite similar to mine when i found out what his full name was i was literally giddy and in a daze for a couple days just seeing the videos he is made makes me happy i can be really stressed out or just feeling depressed or anxious but then he makes me feel better he is super dorky but i find that adorable he has this kind of charming energy and a voice that i find soothing he sounds exactly like jello biafra i have not met him in person yet but i hope to eventually he is not exactly a friendly person all of the time he can be an asshole to people at times i remember impulsively going fullhate mode on him when he said that he hated children then i snapped out of itbut i am still attached to him and sometimes he even finds his way into my dreams then i get upset because it seems real he comes into my mind several times a day like during dinner time i think hmm i wonder what he is eating for dinner or wondering when he is got home from work when he will be sleeping and then imagining him nice and comfy in bed i wonder how he is doing right now i have had these horrible nightmares where i will dream that he died and i would wake up literally sobbing if he died i cannot imagine how depressed i would feel it makes me feel physically sick to imagine anything happening to him i had this dream where he was found dead in a pit of spikes and there was blood everywhere and his eyes and mouth were wide open then i felt him and he was freezing cold it messed me up for days i keep feeling nauseous whenever i think about him like i have been on a rollercoaster or something problem isi have no way of directly contacting him and i am not even sure if he would want me as a friend or not i do not know what to do and i do not feel like i want to discuss this with a doctor in person because i would seem crazy and stalkerish
0,i accidentally landed into a great group of friends this year man this is a rant but i am happy and i just want to share the story so making friends as an adult can be pretty hard do not get me wrong i have friends from high school and that i grew up with but it is also hard to align all our schedules to hang out or people move or you just grow distant my own roommate i barely see because we work opposite schedules but one person i kept in touch with for some reason we worked at a shitty bar when we were 18 they moved to another state but we were well acquaintanted not really even actual friends and then they moved back like 7 years later and we caught up acknowledging how odd it is that we stayed in touch and then out of anything they posted on snapchat about if anyone wanted to play among us and i joined in much to the mild chagrin of their friend group who immediately were like who the fuck is thevampirate but for a time this was how i got to know them all eventually even landing in their actual group chat this goes on for 2 months and as they also all lived in the same general area invited me to a house party i show up late to a series of goofy drunkards who all lined up and asked me guess who everyone is such a silly game for a first impression i did okay and it is all been uphill since that i have gotten to know them all pretty well we go out every week to the same bar we have themed parties every month constant random outings for food or park trips deep and meaningful latenight convos so many photos it is just fun a group of midlate 20something is just living up their lives it does not even matter that i only showed up a few months ago or that some of them have been friends through high school or even elementary they have basically adopted me in like i have always been there it is not always perfect of course but i mean it is pretty damn good this group really works and my heart and soul feel a fullness that i was not even aware was missing until now all through sheer coincidence more than anything funny how that works serendipity or whatever yeah i do not have a good way to end this i just wanted to share some wholesomeness that is been going on since the beginning of this year thanks for reading
0,being in a relationship is a rollercoaster but in the end it is so worth it as with anything in life there are both peaks and lows just ask bitcoin xd but i would like to hop on here to talk about the most important person in my life d my girlfriend and i it is so weird calling her my girlfriend because she is basically my best friend d has changed my life so much and seeing her grow everyday constantly inspires me to do the same she is made me realize that i have a side of me that does not have to be this super macho tough dude it is okay to have a down moment it is okay to talk about things it is okay to not be okay blue_heart white_heart finding that special someone who can be that ear that always listens has brought me so much happiness i am not saying its always dandelions maybe not dandelions she is big boi allergic to them xd and roses for our relationship all the time but talking about the quarrels we experience ultimately strengthen the bond between us even if said quarrels are super hard to talk about bottling it up inside is not the way to go trust me i learned that the hard way always strive for happiness if i had one word to describe my best friend it would be happiness she is done more for me in close to a year than most of my long time friends have it is just a testament of her outstanding character d i want to keep doing everything in my power to keep my best friend happy her smile her eyes her nose the way she smells her amazing sense of humor ability to understand someone elses perspective artistic aptitude and her intelligence are all just a few reasons why she is the perfect one for me 3 i tell her how amazing she is all the time but i felt like i wanted to get it out in the void that is reddit i do not know if she will ever see this and or acknowledge this but if you are i love you so much my awesome blossom blue_heart white_heart ps apologies for the grammar mistakes and idiom overload it is kind of my thing xd ps ps i do not have anything else i just thought it would be cool to have another ps hehe tldr she is definitely the one
0,new job good day i just got promoted to a brand new section at work i went from being the top producer in my division to going over to a completely new division and i started in a supervisory role i am very lost i know generally about what i am supposed to be doing but i feel like such a disappointment because i cannot answer my employees questions every single thing i see is brand new to me and i get so stressed out because i have a limited support system of people to ask questions to everyone is working from home so i cannot even have the luxury of learning a little bit by walking around and interacting with my people i like the people but a lot of them are low performers so i have to start with corrective actions before too long all the other supervisory roles are vacant so i am doing work for 3 teams and my boss is new as well so i cannot really go to her because she does not know the answer either i am so stressed and every single day i get about 20 small fires i need to put out and several large fires and i have no idea how to solve any of them nobody has offered any training materials or support so i have had to find them all myself the worst part is i put in for a supervisory position in my own division but i was pulled over to this team because there were so many vacancies so i have to do admin work for a huge team start hiring processes start performance appraisals despite me only being there 2 weeks i sign off on all their work i do not know for sure if they are doing everything right but i simply do not have the time to check everything and ask questions about everything i get escalated all of the tough things and i get all the heat when things are not going great bottom line i am so stressed out and every day after work i cry because i feel so terrible and i just sit there sad and eating unhealthy food because my energy has been sucked and my motivation is gone i had such a relaxing although boring job before and in trying to expand my horizons i have landed in a personal hell i hate every second of being alive right now and any advice would be much appreciated thanks
0,my boyfriend and i just got approved for our first rental right by my school it is a full house i started college in august 2019 and had to take medical leave a few weeks before my first semester ended because i was experiencing severe psychosis and such it is been such a rough battle since then but i have started taking control of my life like i never had before i do not use eating as a coping skill i do not selfharm anymore even when i have the urges i have almost completely eliminated social media from my daily routine because of how damaging it was for me and now i am able to bounce back from any issue with ease it is such a freeing feeling and it makes me cry tears of happiness i am beginning the process of returning to college and things are all moving so fast and i was worried that my boyfriend and i would not have a place to stay there in town because i am going to live off campus until next semester we applied for a 3 bedroom house rental with my parents as cosigners and i was so worried that we would not get accepted because of how strict house rentals are we have a cat and neither my boyfriend or i had stable jobs right now but we really wanted to avoid apartments because he makes music and needs the space less than an hour ago we got the email that we got approved for the house we have been so stressed about it but now that we know we have a place to go things feel like they really are falling into place it allows my esa it is less than 10 minutes from school it is so spacious and an incredible place for our first rental my boyfriend have essentially lived together for the past year and a half but this will be the first place we live where it is just us and we have it for at least a year probably more since i will be studying away from both of our crazy families that we love back in a city that we fell in love with from the moment we first arrived back to a school where i felt like i belonged there is so many good things happening but this news just makes me want to shout to the world about how happy i am and how accomplished i feel thank you for reading
0,screen time negatives i feel like these screens are more harmful than we realize as we have turned to them during this global lockdown for a way to connect to people safely i feel another trend has arisen and that is the negative effects that these screens have on our interactions demand people expect you to be available at the drop of a hat because they know you are currently glued to your phone hyperbole aside i make sure my phone migrates from room to room with me for work for emergencies it does not stray from my side that does not mean i owe anyone an immediate answer distance you can type things you would not dare say out loud like what i just typed about not owing anyone an immediate response because you cannot see the persons face you are less in tune with their reaction and therefore less concerned about the effect your words will have curating interactions because it is not instant you have time to craft your response that means the exchange of texts or emails when it resembles a conversation is a highly curated interaction in which each participant can choose how long they take to perfect their response while this should promote clarity in that you can take your time to gather information and respond it actually means people have time to manipulate answers intentional on read there can be an effect to silence sometimes silence speaks think about a pregnant pause in natural conversation that let us you know someone is thinking when we can use the screens between us to ignore someone to be silent sometimes that is louder than outright hostility concluding my list as i write this at 00 38 i was up having these thoughts and letting them run their course hoping they would serve the same purpose as counting sheep no luck the contemplation woke me up and for fear of losing my train of thought i immediately reached for my phone now i have extended this late night indefinitely as i labor over this post and begin yet another highly curated interaction between strangers using screens who is with me nerd_face
0,had a really good day today and just wanted to share so where do i start this year has been rough from a failed coming out to covid to a life changing breakup while life has been pretty shitty for my mental health today was a sign of happiness living with my parents has been rough since i have been having to fake being straight and just hide being gay but today i got to see my amazing boyfriend and yes we are both closeted and we met on grindr however despite it being hard for both of us we make it work and honestly i have never loved someone as much before i have never gotten happy over someone elses accomplishments before i have never loved someone no matter if they get a new tattoo or piercing but he changes all of that but back to today i was able to talk to my aunt who i have not seen in a while she does not know i am gay but loves me a lot we was talking about moving out for me and we talked about how hard it will be for my parents but we finally both agreed that it kind of has to happen one day and what is a better time than now fast forward to a few hours later after i saw my bf i was talking to my dad about the idea and i have never mentioned it till now and was so worried because they hate the idea of me leaving them if it was up to them i would live with them forever but he took it rather well i told him it is not like i would move far away legit just like 10 minutes away from our house and while he hated it he understood to an extent it just made me super happy because while it is just a small step it gives me hope that one day i will be able to be truly happy and free my mom however that is going to be a true battle but i will wait for another day for that if someone told me in march when i was not eating for weeks and just crying every night that i would have an amazing boyfriend and an actual chance at being able to be an adult i would think you was crazy there is hope and i hope everyone else has a great daynight thanks for reading if you did

0,it is just another day but my girlfriend might as well be wonderwoman my girlfriend is a nurse and works three twelve hour overnight shifts in a row during the week she lives in seattle while i am in portland we take turns visiting over the weekend at each others homes when i first met her i had switched up my schedule to wake up at 5am to go to the gym and work on my ma before going on with my day i was having difficulty keeping to the regime and when i told her she promised to make sure i got up every day at 5am and to hold me accountable to get these things done every day for the last six weeks that is what she has done whether it be to call me during one of her shifts or setting her alarm to wake up when i would wake up four weeks ago she started sending me a coffee via uber eats or making me one when i finished my gym routine and whatever i needed to do with my ma for the day they say it is the small things that matter in relationships not necessarily the big gestures or grand proclamations of love i have found with her it is true there is so many other thing little things she does and they speak so much in volume about her i had a stressful meeting with a venture capitalist over the weekend and she wrote on a sticky note you got this putting if on my laptop i only noticed it as i was pulling out my laptop and sitting down for the meeting she just smiled and winked at me before leaving the room i just came back from a booking today to find panda express on my porch from her she is pulling overtime today with extra twelve hour shift and she still found the time to send me some freaking food because i had not eaten anything yet today at this point i am astutely and thoroughly blown away by her i am pretty much head over heels in love with her at this point the size of her heart is only outmatched by the size of her brain and my want to keep her laughing at my lame ass puns until she is hoarse

0,people making me feel good about myself all of a sudden i never had many friends i am an introvert and have the kind of face that apparently makes me look unapproachable and arrogant i am neither i am just shy as hell i do not have many friends i have very few but close friends the kind i can trust with my life and vice versa but all of them live hours away so in the city i live in i have only colleagues or acquaintances yet in the last 7 days 3 people i would have considered long time acquaintances at best have contacted me and asked me to hang out they do not know each other so it must be one weird coincidence i went out with all of them had drinks which i know can make me weird and every single one of them said they would like to spend more time with me hang out more often play video games go to the theatre etc i never had anyone show any genuine interest in me ever before unless i had reason to assume they tried to manipulate me eg i look epic in my new dress the sudden male interest clearly has nothing to do with my shining personality and am a bit overwhelmed even tonight i went out and started chatting to random people and met a brazilian author i am a librarian so books are my thing who not only signed me his most recent work to my new stunningly beautiful friend who i hope will one day go out with me but kept complimenting me and even if i had not spoken a word to him just from his looks the way he holds himself etc he would clearly be miles out of my league i am not ugly but at first glance i am not special either something has changed for me i know i have not yet dynamics are so much more in my favour than i ever thought possible i love it i am happy i feel that people finally see the person i am it bothers me because it is too good to be true but right now i am just happy elated content life is good at last

0,my aunt and uncle said they would take me in and let me live with them this is honestly the best news i have received in such a long time like i am legit crying right now and can barely type i posted a few hours ago about my dad passing away a year ago and how my life has felt so empty and cold without him it still does to this day i miss just being in his arms and miss every little thing about him you have no idea and when he passed my aunt and uncle were actually taking some time apart from each other because of marital issues they still came to the funeral and even stayed with me in my apartment for a week after they have always been loving and affectionate and all that even though they were on the other side of the country at the time they did offer me the chance to come live with them but i declined because i still had to finish college he never got to the chance to see me in my cap and gown anyway after i made my posts i quickly called my aunt first and asked her if i could come stay with them eventually my uncle came in and we talked for about a half hour until my uncle asked in a genuinely curious tone why do you want to come now though and i just told them the truth i am scared i do not like being alone like this and not even having a friend nearby for support it is just me but thankfully they reassured me and said they would love for me to come even offering to pay for a plane ticket i cried myself hysterical after they hung up and it is also extremely timely since my lease on my apartment is up in the end of july and i have not renewed yet i am just a mix of genuinely happy but also still sad that he is gone i am not even sure what to do with his ashes since he did not specify where i should take them or anything like that but i am at least more hopeful

0,so i bought myself flowers today no special occasion i just had a tough day at work so i picked up a big bunch of tulips on the way home not the cheap ones either but the lovely fresh perfectly blooming crisp and colorful kind what is the big deal you are probably thinking the big deal is that there was a time in the not so distant past that the thought of treating myself to anything just because filled me with guilt shame and self loathing you do not deserve it it is too good for you you are not worth the timeeffortmoney you are nothing and you have nothing to offer so you deserve nothing in return so now i really appreciate any small act of kindness i afford myself yes there are still days that i force myself to have a cold shower in the morning just because i hate it i love cooking delicious food for other people but i still sometimes eat instant noodles when i am alone and having a bad day because it is a waste of time to cook just for me but today i showed myself a little kindness i acknowledged the fact that i work damn hard and i am great at my job i have value and i am valued tulips are beautiful and so am i i deserve to have beautiful things in my life because i am a badass bitch edit wow thank you everybody honestly i did not expect much of a response to this i was just giving myself a little pat on the back for not being a dick to myself for once lol i am so happy it put a little smile on a few faces and even happier if it reminded even one of you wonderful people to be a little kinder to yourself you are all awesome and to the lovely stranger who gave me gold thank you from the bottom of my heart for that it was a nice surprise to wake up to this morning and put a little pep in my step today

0,i was raised a bigot and tonight i got to pay for my first openly gay friends dinner i am incredibly happy with who i have become over the past 10 years and just wanted to share with someone i was raised in a small town where diversity was not celebrated my family was very anti homosexuality so i ended up doing the same i moved out and went to my states university where i met the first person to logically call me out on my shit i said no homo because that was a thing at the time and he justifiably called me out became good friends and even lived together for a year i ended up dropping out of school to work moved out and lost touch with him in the 10 years since i have met the best friends in my life who are an interracial married gay couple growing up a straight white male in the environment i did this was not something i thought would happen i am ashamed to admit but in middle school i argued all gay people should be sent to an island separate from the world i blame the sheltered town i lived in but mostly myself for accepting that reality where nobody told me it was an incredibly hateful insensitive idea tonight i went to dinner with my best friends and saw my first openly gay friend at a table across the room i did not want to intrude on his groups dinner and i am a coward so i simply asked the waiter to anonymously pay for his tables meal my friends were surprised and i got to enjoy an incredible moment explaining that if it was not for my original friendship with that man that i would not be enjoying this dinner with them at all i very well could have still been a sheltered racist bigot i am smiling wide in reflection of how i have grown and am genuinely happy thanks wayne

0,i managed to finally get my life together and i am proud of it i finally managed to persevere and spend this year improving my body and mind and i am so proud of myself for it i was skinnyfat my whole life and was extremely ashamed of my body to the point where although i lived right next to the sea i would refrain from going since i had to show my skin i have tried exercising my whole life but never stuck to a routine and always ended up quitting after a few weeks as soon as my motivation dwindled i subconsciously always felt embarrassed about not even being able to do a single proper pushup and i knew i was disappointing my dad who was a man who grew up in the ussr where being able to do muscle ups at 15 years old was the norm i had very low self esteem however i am happy to say that i finally managed to persevere and stuck to a routine for the last 6 months even keeping a clean diet during the process what was different this time it is that i finally had access to a gym where i could surround myself with likeminded people having the same goals as me weight training has made me stronger to the point where i could do dozens of pushups as well as multiple pullups which i was never able to do before even for months after starting to exercise regularly i still was too embarrassed to show my body and often times did not go to partys with friends if they involved a pool however today was the first day where i looked myself in the mirror and saw real progress and smiled at myself proudly i felt a lot of energy and motivation seeing how far i have come sorry for the long text but i am just very happy right now and needed a place to vent

0,good step towards progress hey everyone i just joined the group and i think i should share a relatively good breakthrough i had with my stress management i work a grueling job as an essential worker at a grocery chain in the midwestern us this job has really seen me go through the ringer in regards to bending over backwards to make my company happy we are the number one store for sales in the company and one of the ways we are number one is through our online ordering where we seem to have a no ceiling rule where we with accept x number of orders per hour to where around thanksgiving we were doing easily 3040 orders a half hour roughly 10 containers to hold itemsorder couple that with me being the pallet puller who pulls all the orders out to where we let people drive up for their order couple it with a thankless job where they are only using me for my size it gets to be stressful anyhow last night i cracked and i decided to start medicating with otc stress relievers so i bought some of that ashwagandha stuff or whatever and took one about 6 pm last night two hours after my shift and it was amazing i did not feel quite as stressed and as someone who lives naturally with a lot of stressfrustration due to a spectrum disorder and a high stress job i felt honestly the best i have felt since maybe before covid19 took over our lives honestly i hope to leave the job soon due to the stress causing me a lot mental struggles outside of work but i think the ashwagandha was a small step towards becoming less stressed after a year

0,it does not matter if i am interested or not if you are happy i am happy i wanted to post this somewhere and i figured this subreddit was the best place i apologize for any weird formatting i am on my phone so i have this best friend j and he plays video games all the time several hundreds of steam hours spent playing everything from fps games to strategysurvival games and the like about a year and a half ago he invited me to his discord server so i could hang out and meet his other friends i would join to talk or play a few games with him an his friends but for the most part j would stream whatever game he was currently playing for me to watch while i just hung out and talked to him now i enjoy watching him play i really do it is pretty entertaining most times but sometimes he plays games that just are not as interesting for me to watch but have i ever told him that no why because i love hearing him talk he gets excited about this game and will narrate his actions as he plays he will start talking nonstop either to me or just to himself and gets more animated as the night goes on half of the time i understand it but the other half i am completely lost it is very confusing and because of that i do not get as immersed but the reason i keep asking him to stream his game for me is because i love listening to him talk about it i do not think he knows how much i love to listen to him if he is passionate about it then i am more than happy to listen to him talk for hours and enjoy how happy he sounds
0,i got extra credit on my science project probably nobody cares but i am just sooo insanely proud of myself and i really want to talk about it we had to do a project on energy sources and i did a bunch of research on wind turbines and made a google slide and everything it was pretty interesting because i actually learned how they worked i was really nervous when i was presenting because i did not know what they would think of my presentation because i thought it was not as good as the other ones but when i went to present it is like my mind went blank and some weird part of my brain took over i started making jokes explaining in detail making up my own sentences without even using my slide project i opened my presentation with prepare to get blown away because it was on wind turbines and everyone laughed and then i went through every slide i had and explained it all way better than i thought i would i did stumble over a few words but it was not that bad here is the best part when i finished it was all silent for a second and then my science teacher said ashlyn that was awesome and then everyone was clapping i was the last person to present and the teacher did not react that way even for the people who i thought had the best presentations i am glad i was wearing a mask because nobody could see how teary i was getting and how much i was grinning then when i looked up my grade i saw he gave me 10 extra credit i do not know i am just soooooo happy i have never been this proud of myself before
0,after struggling with enormous selfdoubt for a long time my dream job landed in my lap my whole life i have been hypercritical of myself and i think i have undiagnosed adhd my confidence in myself is shot i had a bad graduate school experience where my advisor always shot me down and i was convinced i was useless in this profession i have loved and been studying toward since i was a kid then covid happened and everything seemed even more hopeless i was depressed and feeling very lost i was even thinking about giving up music to pursue something easier with better pay then i was spontaneously offered my dream job by a mentor i once had no application or interview because they believed in me that much all i had to do was sign the contract i am pretty young and inexperienced but they have so much faith in me that has to mean i have some value right i start this week and so far i have gotten to work with and form a colleague relationship with this person who has been my idol for a decade they inspired me to become a musician and pursue my dreams in the first place i feel like i could not even dream up a better scenario for myself i am just over the moon my existence feels meaningful and validated what do i even do with all of this gratitude while i am terrified of ruining it and the job is really nothing huge it is big to me i cannot believe i have this opportunity and cannot help but feel the universe has my back in some weird way i just needed to tell someone thanks for reading
0,this may be one of the best days of my life just a normal day of doing house chores teaching my nephew driving my sister to work and when i got home i received an email for nearly a year i have been waiting for this internship in an aviation company due to covid my internship got postponed i thought they ignored my application or whatever but today i received an email saying i am going to start my internship next week i jumped out of joy and excitement first thing when i read it i am just so happy thinking about chancescoincidences this is the perfect time to get out of my house because i recently got vaccinated and thinking about the stuff i did during the pandemic i learned a lot about myself and about the things i thought i would never like and i got to help a lot in our house especially helping my nephew who has autism i remembered the times when i had breakdowns pandemic anxiety creeping in asking myself why are these bad things happening to me i encountered a lot of problems especially with my family but thing got better and i did still do my best to understand things from their point of view looking back i was a person made out of worry i worried and overthought everything which led me to anxiety and breakdowns with the help of the people around me especially my boyfriend who is my number 1 supporter i learned a lot about prioritizing better things in my life and not worrying too much and this day is a very good example of the quote in the picture
0,does my depressed girlfriend realize rather than feel that she loves me hi everyone my 31m girlfriend 28f of 4 years suffers from depression and she is currently going through a rough period i have never understood depression and i have accepted that i never will so i just try to be as supportive as i can with information from places like this subreddit however one question that i have always had and was afraid to ask why cannot she own up to it she is currently going through tough times these days she does not feel love for me or anyone else and is completely miserable this is something that i can accept as being depression but why cannot she just say something like i know that i love you even though i do not feel it or thank you for taking care of me i know this must suck for you she could even say i know i do not feel grateful right now but rationally i realize that you are amazing for taking care of me one small sentence like that would mean the world to me and i cannot imagine that she does not realize this i hope this post will not be interpreted the wrong way she is struggling with something horrible and i am complaining about wanting some compliments on the internet but some days i feel like i cannot take this anymore thank you to anyone who reads this edit a few hours after posting this with a throwaway account she texted me a heart no explanation no words she is still unresponsive in her bed this is the absolute highlight of my week
0,our conscious awareness is one of our most powerful tool in this life being in full control of it opens us up to receive the infinite cosmic energy from the universe did he just say infinite yes and you can see how this energy truly is by noticing how every second we get a new opportunity to change our state of being point of view and mental state child hood traumas events that happened or even words that were said a long time ago can hurt and carry through into our adulthood robbing us of our aliveness and spontaneity there is a tendency to store the energy of an unresolved trauma by locking it in the body even if the situation happened only once an unreleased and unresolved trauma can become trapped within the body and its energy field causing tension stress and possibly disease releasing this stored suppressed or blocked energy is a healthy natural process that allows a person to resolve issues and to become more alive one simple method to release this energy is by clearing it from your meridians channels through which flows energyspiritual chills euphoria voluntary goosebumps ecstasy prana chi qi vayus aura mana life force pit rapture ruah ether nephesch chills goosebumps the force if you are interested into doing this free and simple method here is a youtube video for you and here is my reddit community rspiritualchills where you can share your own experiences talk and ask questions about your spiritual energy
0,after a long struggle with mental illness i got hired about 3 weeks ago for a demanding job i was so worried about not being able to prove myself today was goals revision and retrospective and almost everyone praised my performance and expressed positive response towards my leadership i got the job after 3 years of freelancing because of mental health issues the job is animation team leader it is basically a dream job for me and i have been doing overtime just because i love it so much i have always loved my job and being an animator but it is the first time for me to be this happy and i never imagined that i could enjoy my job even more than before i am doing my best but i had doubts about my performance but today so many people praised how well i fit the job how much they like my style of leadership how well i fit within the team how fast i got involved in everything my boss was also happy about it and most importantly my team had nothing but good things to say about me i am a bit tough and blunt so i worried that they might be upset about my way of giving feedback but the senior animator expressed that he liked that i am straight to the point and did not see it as a bad thing i am so happy that i cannot stop thinking about it i never imagined that i would be here and that i would achieve this much in such a short time tldr i am kicking ass at my new job despite my worries

0,found a potential life partner and i could not be happier i met this girl on hinge she and i instantly hit it off and had long conversations over text after a few days i suggested a meetup to continue our conversation in person and she agreed we met ate some food and walked through a park while sharing our lives to eachother the next date did not go as well she was in a different state and it was virtual i was not in the right mindspace and it felt awkward throughout the whole thing i thought i had ruined it she even picked up on it and suggested we do not date anymore but wanted to stay friends and maybe meet up after she got back a few weeks later conversation continued and we met up again just to hang out and have fun doing something together flirting popped back up between us and it felt like sparks were flying so at the end of the day i asked if she wanted to try again she was hesitant and said she would let me know a few months later we are still dating staying over at each others houses having 10 hour phone calls and more recently have been recording ourselves reciting books poems and short stories for the other to fall asleep to when we cannot be together or on the phone this is the first time in a long time i have been this happy with someone else and i really hope she becomes my forever partner 3
0,how i overcame my pornography addiction why i started to change my life for the better this is tough for me to talk about but i thought this story will help inspire men growing up as a teenager i had a really bad pornography addiction i used to watch it 7 days a week and it really took an impact on my social life and it really made me lose my confidence it made my dating life and sex life horrible i knew i was better than that i could not believe this was taking over my life and how could i let it get this far so one day i was like fuck this i need to get my life together i started to set goals and strategies by locking all porn websites and started bettering my life by going to the gym and finding new hobbies i tried playing basketball and started doing cycling classes it was amazing i met some great friends i started eating healthier i did everything i could to take my mind off it i started to find passions and hobbies and became a personal trainer i even started dating again due to all the sex dysfunctions from watching all the pornography it was a very tough process but i was able to power through this shit and get my life somewhat together after 6 12 months so the moral of the story is do not let these addictions control you what controls your mind controls your life mental toughness
0,so many people have told me that they care and that i need to keep them in my life i live across the ocean from my home country and it is very isolating i always felt so alone recently i have come to my country and visiting aunts cousins siblings that i have no contact with and they all tell me to not exclude myself even cousins that i have not had much contact in my life have told me that they want to know how i am doing and so and so i never knew they cared about me like this i am going through a break up from an abusive relationship and hearing about how they value me as a person makes me happy i do not know how to explain but it really gives me comfort i have been so down before that i had to be hospitalized for a week and i felt that no one cared but i know that it is not the truth family is the most important to me and i feel glad that these people want to be apart of my life the support i am receiving and people that are listening to me and understanding my side and telling me that they want the best for me that they know i deserve better is overwhelming great i feel like before people gaslighted the shit out of me saying i was making a big deal out of nothing and things like that to not be laughed at is amazing it feels a lot easier to let go of my traumas with the support i am receiving

0,i have read that we are not aware of 90 of what is going on around us in terms of energy electromagnetic fields vibrations spirits angels brainwaves wavelengths frequencies and ect personally i believe in this especially because i have experienced a lot of events that many would consider weird hallucinations paranormal and spiritual for example i went to bed to my girlfriend who just had fallen asleep a couple of minutes earlier and right after laying down i saw this glowing green orb exiting her body coming in front of me as if it was looking at me and then reversing outside my bedroom window i am 100 sure it was her spiritlight body or whatever you want to call it one time i was meditating buddha style with my eyes halfway closed and saw this huge glowing golden orb approach me nowadays while thinking or talking to someone i get to see these shining small orbs appear out of nowhere and stay there for a while all varying in different colours nowadays i mostly see blue all of this has been happening to me since 2013 when i have started meditating and getting really into spirituality if you are interested i have made this youtube video about which method of meditation opened my awareness to be able to witness these sightings let me know your thoughts on it
0,paying close attention to your morning coffee can help you start your day with happiness we are told that if we want to be happy we need to exist in the present moment but what does that actually mean one helpful way to think about it is living through your senses what you can perceive right now as humans we have many senses a lot more than five and we can use these to pull us back from worries about the future and regrets from the past take drinking a cup of tea or coffee as an example we can listen to the kettle boiling look at the colour if the drink and the mug that its in you have probably seen it 1000 times but you can look at it with beginners mind as if you have never seen it before feeling the warmth of the cup in your hands smelling the tea before you drink it noticing the taste flavour feeling it pass down our throat there are many more perceptions for us to focus on by tuning in to these we ground ourselves in the present moment we calm ourselves and we can draw happiness from our everyday lives applying this awareness to your morning tea or coffee is an easy way to start to integrate awareness of the here and now into your life listen on apple podcasts listen on google podcasts listen on spotify other ways to listen

0,today i had my first session with my psychologist it was tense i talked him through some dark stuff he showed empathy like no other and i immediately felt like i already knew him and vice versa at the end of the session he asked for my id for administrative purposes when he saw my date of birth and realized it was my birthday he cracked up and through his chuckles he demanded who the hell sets up an appointment on his birthday of course i could not care less if it was my birthday i tend to forget my own age however his laugh was so genuine and from such a good heart that at last i recognized the ridiculousness and joined his laughter it was the first time i felt 100 comfortable with another person in the same room i could not have asked for a better present edit i cannot thank you all enough for the wishes and positivity i have been an active rdepression dweller for the past few months and i have never been let down recovery or not this community will always have a special place in my heart the bond that links your true family is not one of blood but of respect and joy in each others life i know it is far fetched but it applies for me today

0,the thought of the minuscule chance of coming across my boyfriend on bumble two years ago makes me incredibly grateful to have him today i came across my boyfriend in 2019 on bumble not sure what my profile looked like or his or what it said but i am happy we matched we went on a date and we were very similar however we were both busy and never set up a second date fast forward a year later he requested me randomly on instagram which we had never shared with each other i messaged him and the next week we were on a date it lasted like 8 hours and we just talked and talked and talked it was amazing since then we have been together moved in and are almost at a year we are like the same person and i could not be more grateful for him it may sound silly but i think of the very tiny chance of meeting him on the app or the tiny chance of coming across each other again and it makes me so much more grateful for him last year before we met again he had a plan to move back east after college this year he stayed in my state with me just feeling super blessed and i know sometimes dating apps are not great but sometimes you come across some great people

0,i have been left out of everything and someone actually cared so basically my school is crap teachers do not care about me being left out or bullied half of my time here i did not think the students did until today there was an odd number of girls today since one was off and we had to go into pairs of course none wanted to go with me and neither did any one of the boys so i sat at the side and said i was fine not doing it however one of the boys asked why i could not go in a three with one of the girls pairs if you could not tell i am female and in my school girls and boys do not like to go together much but all of them said no this is a paired activity so he actually got really mad and called them all assholes and said how he noticed how they all treat me like shit and asked if i wanted to go in his pair he got a detention just at lunch break for swearing in front of the teacher and multiple small children passing by but it honestly warmed my heart so much and it showed me that maybe there is some good left in humanity and that someone actually cares it was the first time i would felt happy in a long time to be honest

0,my brother is using his disability against us my brother is 17 and when he gets too stressed his legs can go out but over time he has learned to use that against us he will play on his ps4 all day long and then tell us that he cannot do anything because his legs are out he has caused my mom to owe the electric company 1000 dollars because she cannot keep up with every month having to pay 200300 dollars we told him to stop playing so much but as soon as we go to sleep he is playing from 11pm3 am even if he already played for 8 hours that day we take the game away and he starts yelling at us about how good we are to take the only thing that can calm him down we have tried to tell him to get out but he says he has nothing to do we give him options and he does not want to do it we tell him about all the times he stayed on for hours with a fanheater and laptop all on and he starts arguing about the few days he actually did not play at all what is the best way to get it into his head that just because hes mad or cannot move his legs that does not mean it is ok for him to waste so much electricity
0,so grateful for my partners support and love i have always been obsessed with the idea of feeling at home and have struggled to truly find it i was neglected as a child making it feel like there was no safe place for me to escape and relax to and i have been living on my own moving from place to place for the past few years and nothing has felt right it is always felt so temporary and like i am just waiting and hoping the next place fulfils that void i am moving again midmonth so i am crashing at my boyfriends place for two weeks and he has made it his mission to make his space feel like a home for me because he knows how much it means to me he has been cleaning organizing and prepping his room for my stay and i am just so grateful for how much he is doing for me he even said that i could make a small garden in his backyard because he knows how much i have always wanted one of my own and since i have been apartment living i have never been able to have one myself i have never felt this loved before nor experienced someone making me feel so happy and grateful for their existence

0,i have never had a day start out as good as today has i work at a wendys burger joint at the moment usually at the drive through window and anyone who is worked fast food will know that it is rarely a fun job well today started out with a bunch of rain our store does not have an awning so i was getting soaked pretty typical so far but then it was just rapid fire wholesomeness i had one of our regulars hand me a 5 tip and tell me that i deserve it and that i am a great worker i had a pretty damn attractive person ask for my number i am already engaged but that felt really nice to hear and just before my break i had 5 customers pay for the person behind them in a row and the only reason the last guy did not is because there was not anyone behind him now i am a pretty cynical person so i am expecting something awful to happen at some point today to balance everything out but man my self esteem is through the roof today and people are being so nice is there something in the soda edit thanks for the awards

0,i made myself smile today and hopefully a few others too so for a while now i have made it a mission whenever i visit a cafe to pay it forward i am financially comfortable so am happy to share that where i can if i am out for coffee maybe once a week when paying my bill i pick another table or customer and anonymously pay their bill i do not say anything i just pay and leave and hope that person or small group smiles a little when they go to leave today at a cafe which was not the cheapest place i might add i noticed a table of 4 with a caregiver and 3 intellectually challenged individuals having a meal i asked the cashier quietly to pay their bill as i paid my own as i walked to my car i was really happy and it was purely because of the feeling i had from that moment of doing something anonymously for someone else i am posting this not to boast but to share a smile of my own that hopefully was shared by that caregiver when she went to pay her bill
0,just attended my first theatre performance in a year i cannot get over how surreal it felt to actually attend a theatre performance especially since i used to frequent art performances theatre opera ballet concerts before the pandemic i missed it so much and it was so nice to get to feel this high the preperformance gathering drinks walking up to the hall getting your ticket checked settling in your seat and then the dimming of the lights the applause at the end really hit home how important culture is and the emotion it brings i cannot imagine how elated the actors felt after such a long period of inactivity and finally an appreciative audience to thank them for all their hard work it was strictly regulated with only people with certificates recovery or vaccine allowed plus they checked ids to make sure the certificate was assigned to this person kudos to them for being careful while providing their services

0,i never thought that i could do it but yesterday i got my college acceptance letter i have been struggling in community college for about four years now ever since the beginning of high school school has been super hard for me even though i was a star student before that about a year ago i got diagnosed with severe bipolar disorder depression and ocd after talking it through with my therapist and psychiatrist we came to the conclusion that i have had these mental illnesses undiagnosed for about ten years school has always been so intimidating for me because nobody in my family went to college so i did not really have any help plus i was scared because i have such low self esteem and did not think i could make it but i did i got my acceptance letter yesterday for the university that i want to go to i know it is not over yet and i still have a lot of work to do but i am really proud of myself for getting here
0,some people are just never depressed i remember months ago when my boyfriend told me he does not think he is ever really been depressed before hearing him say that completely blew my mind because my life has been the exact opposite for as long as i can remember and if i had the same kind of experience as him i would be in such a better place right now i used to think people like that would crumble the moment something really bad happens to them but in all honesty it seems to be a strength rather than a weakness his dog who he really loved recently died and he was sad for maybe a week or two but then just bounced right back from it like nothing even happened cannot imagine what that must be like i am happy for him since i would hate to see him have to suffer through that but also admittedly envious guess some people are just lucky enough to never have to experience this kind of daily hell that never really goes away

0,treat yourself like you treat your best friend hey everyone just wanted to share this quick mindset with you did you know out of the 30000 average thoughts a person has a day 80 are negative and 95 are repetitive as a result our minds begin to automatically and subconsciously have negative thoughts cognitive behavioral therapists call this automatic negative thoughts this leads to stress anxiety and fear a great way to help this is by adopting the mindset treat yourself like you treat your bestfriend a great starting point is to reframe any negative thoughts you have about yourself instead of i am not smart enough to do this try i have already learned so much and will continue to learn this has been shown to boost both your health and happiness put simply if you would not say it to your bestfriend do not say it to yourself hope this helped you

1,i am begging somebody to read this i desperately need to feel like i have a friend there for me right now posting this on a few subs because i do not know what to do i feel like i have reached my breaking point i am so tired i am so tired of existing i am so tired of being mad i am so tired of being tired it is pathetic i am a 25 year old adult who is stuck living at home with my family i can feel myself falling apart and i am reaching the point where i am finally just going to take myself out of this shitty game called life or i am going to end up cutting ties all together with my family which is where i will probably sink if it is sink or swim out in the big world i am holding on to so many grudges from so many years that i clearly cannot cope with in a healthy way my heart hurts so much but i am such a glutton for punishment that i cannot bring myself to stop carrying around all this hate and it is absolutely one hundred percent consuming me alive i will try and use brackets to section off my thoughts since i doubt anybody cares enough to actually read this all the way through my thoughts on my father as an adult now i realize that i spent probably the first 18 years of my life living in literal fear of my pseudo racist father i still remember being 6 years old or so and hearing my mother scream for my brother because my father was choking her in their bedroom was a big steroid fan back in the day i spent most of my middle school and high school career grounded from one semester to the next one because i frequently got cs in school which my parents would ground us for even one c on the report card and it was grounded for the rest of the semester i still remember getting in trouble so badly for lying about doing my homework not even so much for not doing my homework but it was distinctly about lying about it my father was beating me in our dining room and at one point was physically choking me against the wall and i remember my mother saying well do not choke him insert name and him looking straight at her with his hands around my neck saying i am not choking him i still remember that same night him having to come in my room to change my ice packs on my swollen face and how petrified i was that the gameboy sp i was playing was flung off the bed in a room with no carpet because i was certain i was going to get beat again i remember going to school the next and having to tell my teachers because all six of them forced me to stay after class and talk about it that i was playing football with my brother and fell on a sprinkler funny how their response to me lying about homework was to in turn go to school and lie about why half of my face was swollen and black i remember the first time i was ever caught shoplifting was obviously my last time doing it too when my dad came to pick me up he was already so nasty to me before leaving the store that the police threatened to not let me leave because he was already trying to hit me in front of them but you know now that i am an adult and have been jumped literally just because of my sexuality if i am going to get my ass beat i am going to get my ass beat i am just not living in fear anymore my thoughts on my brother which brings me to my brother who as of lately might as well be dead to me we have not currently spoken since april and as far as i am concerned we probably will not ever speak again let us start with me saying i feel like my brothers relationship with me has always been from the start me bailing him out when he needs it i remember being in elementary school and him getting to go back to sleep after my mother woke us up for breakfast and would leave for work because it was my job to wake him up after rugrats when he was about 12 or 13 he got mixed up with a bad neighborhood kid and ended up almost lighting an entire house on fire in our neighborhood the police officers were nice enough to offer him the deal that if you stay out of trouble until you are 18 this will be completely removed off your record with no trace of it ever even happening sure enough he starts smoking weed in high school which is back when it was highly frowned upon and guess who had to take every single drug test for his four years of high school my dumb ass bailing him out again until finally he got caught coming back late from lunch upper class men were at the time allowed to leave campus for lunch and he came back with a hotboxed car and did not air it out so when the principle stopped him to ask why he was late she was literally hit with a cloud of smoke my brother was the sole reason my high school was no longer allowed to leave campus for lunch my brother and father have always had an awful relationship too obviously all this places even more tension on it and eventually lead to him either being kicked out or leaving i do not remember which being on the streets on his own he was arrested more times for carrying stupid large amounts of weed on him because he sells it and eventually got charged i think with robbery then to top it all off a few years ago my brother got mixed up in the flocka epidemic and of course there is my dumbass bailing him out again being forced to put two stolen bikes in my car and drive him to miami when i first started realizing how much i hated him was i think my senior year of high school my parents had gone out of town leaving him in charge i remember distinctly it was the night before vans warped tour he is in a huge fight with his at the time girlfriend because he was literally hitting either her or her andor her kid and i remember he stormed into my room flinging open the door trying to use me as an excuse is not this okay because it is what dad used to do to us of course having a criminal record he could not find a job and was on probation at my parents house and because nobody wanted to hire somebody with his record they literally gave him a fucking job at the company my father works for this job is 15 an hour gets benefit and vacation days i on the other hand spent years being treated like shit in jobs two years ago i worked for quiksilver over the course of about a year finally left because they told me and a coworker that we were the ones being considered for management and yet they brought in two outside hires after the second one the other coworker had the sense to leave my dumb ass stayed thinking well now that she is gone it will look better on me which is when they brought in another outside hire who i was eventually cool with i just stopped offering to do the management work for sales associate pay until i finally got so fed up that i transferred to gamestop because they were willing to start me as a keyholder since i already had basic management training so two years trying to work for a manager only to be shit on by my parents because it is not full time and at your age your brother worked full time at my age you all gave him a fucking career because nobody wanted to hire a literal criminal anything i do it is just never going to be good enough let me talk about our most recent altercation because it is a fantastic transition into my mother as of last april i was unfortunately unemployed thanks to this whole virus outbreak and of course that sets off my family members because i sleep all day while they work so my mother asked me on april 20th the day before my birthday a day that i was operating on approximately 2 hours of sleep because i am always up all night if i could go help my brother in the warehouse where he works because he really needs it i have already had altercations with my brother there from helping him a previous time it was so bad that they sent me home early so being there in general makes me uncomfortable even when i go in to help my dads department so of course i did not want to help which was not an acceptable answer to my mother and after about the 5th time of her saying something obviously i snapped and agreed to which she responded forget it and slammed my door shut it should be noted that in my mothers defense i am a nightmare to wake up because of how little i sleep there are times i wake up and am in a fight with my mother because she apparently tried to wake me up and i was nasty meanwhile i have literally no recollection of even speaking to her so my dumb ass trying to bite the bullet agrees to go work for eight hours in a hot sweaty warehouse with barely any ac on my birthday of all days i woke up that morning still mad about the fight i had with my mother the day prior because i feel like as a grown ass adult i should be allowed to say no i do not want to do something get to the warehouse work the shift i leave at five which apparently was a mistake because i was not supposed to leave until 5 30 which i thought was fine because 1 i genuinely thought they left at 5 every day and 2 i did not take a lunch break because i was hoping if we happened to get everything done early we would just be able to leave obviously that was wrong and i got a shitty passive aggressive text message from my brother having already been in a bad mood from my fight with my mother the day before partnered with my brother annoying me after i had left i stopped by aunts house to vent because i was literally seeing red was not even planning on going home for my birthday because i just did not want to be around any of them the next day comes and i do not show up because not only did i not want to be there but when i had gotten there the day before another employee of that company said we do not know if we will need you tomorrow or not yet so i just did not bother to show up because if you all needed me you should have worked that into your text message when you were being an asshole in my opinion so of course my petty ass is not going to show up my brother comes home through the door does not even put his shit down and is in my face screaming at me for not showing up why should i have to explain to my boss why you did not come why do you get to sleep all day while we work i am sick of it turning to my mother i am sick of him are not you all sick of him to which she agrees probably just trying to get him to calm down but i will not ever for a second forget you just said you were sick of me and of course i am running my mouth back in return which is when he decided to put his hands on me shoving me literally to the floor and this is about where i black out with anger because i had my nintendo switch in my hand the limited edition no longer in production animal crossing themed one at that so obviously i am pissed and yank his playstation out of the wall and slam it on the ground you can skip the next parentheses part if you do not care about why a stupid video game console made me so upset a detour to mention about these video game consoles my brother and i used to exclusively use xbox but i made the transition to the ps4 when it came out my brother did not i had been asking for a playstation 4 since they came out for both my birthday and christmas for i think like two years until the year my brother spent christmas in jail because he was addicted to flocka when my mom finally bailed him out because she felt like he was actually clean he got a playstation 4 when i asked why he got one and i did not despite it literally being the only thing i asked for as a christmas gift she said well he was not here for christmas so i had to make it special i think i eventually got the playstation for my birthday the following year but this fucking switch man i swore up and down when i was a gamestop employee that they were going to make an animal crossing version and they all laughed at me said if it was going to happen it would have already and talked me into buying just a standard switch instead low and behold a few weeks later the animal crossing one is announced and i am lowkey heartbroken that i just spent a majority of my money on the standard one i eventually get myself so worked up over it that i asked my mom to front me the money to buy the new system and i will give her 200 when i sell my switch and the rest from my next paycheck she is talking some i cannot i do not have that kind of money which would have been totally fine i was just embarrassed that i not only put my pride away to ask for money but was also upset enough about not getting the animal crossing one to even be in this situation so whatever whatever we end up agreeing on if i sell the console first and give her the two hundred she will give me the rest where as i was only asking her for the front because i did not want to risk selling my console before the new one came out and risk then not having a console at all especially since i had already missed like two years of the switches lifespan so obviously i am super thankful to my mom and i literally spent like two days thanking her and talking to her about it only for me to find out that she had given me my own money i do not know what it was for possibly my unemployment since the console came out around the time the virus was starting to flare and at that point all i can keep thinking is wow you really kept my own money from me made me gamble on being able to find a limited edition console without a preorder and told me you could not loan me anything that makes me so mad how are you going to lie about my own damn money serves me right i guess for not being adult enough to stop using our joint bank account anyway i slam his playstation on the ground after he put his hand on me the first time we get into a screaming match in his room to which i say something along the lines of you are allowed to knock my switch out of my hand so why should you expect any different of your playstation to which he responds talking out of his ass well you did not pay for it mom did jokes on you asshole not only did i pay for it entirely with my money but our mother literally withheld my own money from me and made it more difficult for me to get an already difficult to get console this ends up with him coming back into my room because everyone in my family myself included has to have the last word in argument which leads to him putting his hands on me a second time except this time since there is not a 400 gaming system in my hand i pull his disgusting ass down with me this whole fight somehow ends with me being kicked out of my house by my mother my thoughts on my mother fun fact maybe about a week before this my mother was begging me to stop going out despite taking precautions with a mask and specially made sanitizer consisting of primarily alcohol because they had a friend in critical condition from covid this is the same woman who threw her kid out into streets during the first peak of this epidemic i am in florida so it is at this moment higher than that first peak because floridians are trash so i spend the next three or four day sleeping in my car doing whatever trying to manage on my own spending what little money i had fixing the joycon drift on my switch that was non existent until my brother attacked me with it in my hand one thing leads to another and i eventually end up back home i asked my mom if we could start family therapy because i am literally holding onto grudges that i do not know how to let go of she says when all of this is over but i am positive she is forgotten about it and it might very well be what causes me to cut her out all together a few days ago me and my mother got into a huge arguement because she woke me up to ask me to take her to firestone to pick up her cari am exhausted but totally not a problem to me at all so i get right up get dressed grab my keys and when i walk out of my room she goes are you ready now i am not in a rush or anything i was a little annoyed by the stupid question i will admit like you just two minutes ago came into my room to wake me up and ask me to take you yes i am ready to go lol otherwise i would still be asleep she of course takes my flat response a slight mixture of both my annoyance and exhaustion as me being in a bad mood so we get into my car and she is overreacting because my car is a little shaky which i am almost positive is just because i need air in my tires talking some oh my god we have to pull over what if you have a flat like we definitely would know if we were driving on a flat tire it is been doing this since like the second week i got this car so i am just sitting there trying to get to the destination as fast as possible trying to hold my tongue and not because a fight when she sets me off and says something along the lines of you are in a bad mood because i asked you to take me my response being oh what i am in a bad mood because i got right up to do something you asked me to do which fucking infuriated me and caused a screaming match in my car i do not understand why she has this god complex where she thinks she gets to tell other people how they feel about something she did it to me on my birthday too which i forgot to mention and am now too lazy to go back and add in but like it drives me crazy i do not care if they are right wrong or somewhere in between nobody has the right to decide how somebody feels about something except for that person so when i sit there and tell you i am not mad and you tell me yes you are mad that is why you are being shitty that is a self fulfilling prophecy right there of course that shits going to make me mad if you are just going to decide i am in a bad mood for me then shit i guess i am in a bad fucking mood then so this screaming match in my car leads to her saying i hope something happens to your car and when it does do not call me i will never ever in a million years forget she said that to me i hope that when something does happen to my car i am inside of it i hope it is something fatal and i hope she has to live with it for the rest of her life and then of course after our screaming match she sends me a passive aggressive text message because apparently my family is famous for doing that shit talking some i will not be screamed at in a car that i bought you you are so disrespectful the next time you talk to me like that you can find a new place to live as if she did not kick me out when i was 16 and 18 and 23 like clearly i can manage in my car bitch try me i would rather starve to death on the streets than feel like i need help from someone who treats me like shit skip the parentheses if you do not care about context with my car history both me and my brother were fortunate enough to get cars for our 16th birthday the difference between us is my brother has wrecked i think 2 cars my parents bought him one car they gave him because my mom got a new car which that one he was not at fault for but still it is a car to add to your tally and ruined one of my dads trucks that he was using for whatever reason one day i on the other hand drove the same car that i had since i was 16 until literally this year when i turned 25 and was given a new one but honestly my parents had been trying to buy me another one for a few years i just fought them on it because i did not want a new car which i will explain why later and then now just today we are in another arguement because i think last night my brother walked out our back gate to go sell drugs in our mailbox because he thinks he is cool and tough and can handle jail as if he is not literally crying mommy bail me out when he is in there as he is going out he knocks over the ashtray i had been using over there which was admittedly in the walkway but only because that particular night i was in a hurry to relocate under my backyard awning because it was raining and i had all my technology on me but when he walks back he has the nerve to say to me your ashtray is knocked over as if i was not outside and heard him kick it over like i am supposed to lean up after him despite us having literally not a said a word to eachother since april so i hid the ashtray that he normally uses with the mindset of if he needs an ashtray he will have to go over and clean up the one he kicked over only for me to find that my mother ended up being the one to clean up his mess which of course infuriated me and then she had the nerve to defend him in a text message after we got into an arguement about it well it is your ashtray okay did i kick over my ashtray or did my brother because that is the person who should have cleaned it up was who knocked it over in regards to my mother specifically it hurts me the most because i often at times feels like she is the only one out of the 3 of my immediately family that i could have a relationship with or that i actively want to have a relationship with and that bridge is so close to being burnt to a crips i do not want to appear ungrateful because as a mother she does go above and beyond i have been spoiled sure but my problem with it is i feel like my mother only gives as much as she gives so that she has ammunition to hold over peoples head i fought her for years about getting a new because i knew she would just hold it over my head which obviously i was right about i remember being kicked out when i was 18 because i was not working and i had just gotten kicked out of college and she said leave your keys pack your stuff and find somewhere to live so i did set off with no car no money no nothing ended up being taken in by my best friends family spent a year or two there and i literally did not get my car back the same one she had given me at 16 until the girl i was living with literally called her in tears asking if we could just borrow it so we could go see her mother who was in the hospital because she needed brain surgery literal brain surgery was the only reason i got my car back and it still took my friend like two or three times of asking my mother for her to let me use my car just to take her to see her mother my father has always babied me and let me get away with more than he let us my brother get away with i can admit that the problem with it is that because i do not feel the same type of yearning for a relationship about my father that i do about my mother i do not really care about him favoring me and because my dad tends to let me get away with more my mom feels like she has to let my brother get away with more which in turn causes me to always just feel like i am chasing my mothers approval or some shit thoughts on my own disgusting self it is only been recently that i am starting to come around to my father and that is only because i think i am starting to hate my mother i know i probably sound ungrateful and entitled and i can see why but i am truly thankful for how privilege i have been and all that i have been given but i do not know how to not feel the way that i feel about these things and that is not to say i am perfect either i have caused plenty of problem for my family so let me just skip to all my flaws now when i was a kid like before i could even start kindergarten i was literally already sucking dick my next door neighbor my brothers age at the time used to make me do it to him and i used to agree because he was considerably nicer to me when i do would so he was already a problem child too but that is neither here nor there i was pretty much only sucking him off because my brother always hated when i would hang out with him and his friends and the neighbor always let me hang around for obvious reasons distinctly remember my brother catching us a few times but i guess nothing was ever done about it not even sure if my parents know about it but as an adult i can see that is where i started getting fucked up i do not know if i necessarily blame my neighbor for me being gay because i do firmly as a gay man believe that it is just who you are and cannot be changed but i feel like there will literally always be a part of me that questions it like what if i was not sucking dick at five years old would i be interested in girls i remember having a crush on at least two different girls before i met what i now as an adult realize was probably my first boy crush like looking back on my child hood i vividly remember playing doctor with other kids or truth or dare that always ended sexual and i realize like damn that is fucking gross we were all kids fast forward to me being in i think middle school and i was caught sexually experimenting with my cousin i was definitely old enough to know better so i take fault there but i also was not ever the one initiating it you know i was letting him suck me off for longer than i can remember honestly but i also distinctly remember i was not the one initiating it i still remember the first night at his house when he asked me to go pornhub and grilling him about how he even knows about that i do not remember when i started letting him do stuff to me but i know that i should not have i remember well enough that when he would come sleepover there were times i would opt to stay up late with my father in hopes that he would fall asleep waiting for me to come in i remember one time i was up late and he comes walking out like 2 hours after being put to bed because he was trying to get me to come in to bed with him but again i was the older kid in that situation so that is my fuck up obviously when we got caught it put a wedge between that side of our family i can see why but in hindsight i always wonder would you have still distanced yourself if you knew it was your son who had been initiating it because he was younger all the blame was pushed onto me and i can see why again i should have known better that is probably around the time i started getting fat by high school at one point i was over 300 pounds and openly gay never had a serious relationship never even had someone interested in a relationship with me i can see why not only was i cringey in high school but i was literally disgusting it was not till about my senior year i finally got back under 300 pounds and started losing some weight and gaining some confidence but here is the kicker before i started losing the weight i had become a literal serial catfisher and i am talking like anybody you wanted to see naked i would go out of my way to target friends friends boyfriends nobody was off limits to me it makes me sick thinking about the hundreds of people i have catfished because i was horny and lonely catfishing even basically got me kicked out of my college granted i was surprisingly innocent at that time but because the kid found out about me being a catfish he refused to believe it was not me despite me literally having to show my catfish accounts to the dean and them not matching up to whoever he was talking to the college only realized their mistake a semester or two later because the kid was immediately put on academic probation the semester following my suspension and then got caught trying to do the same thing to another gay student the semester after that which is when they were like wow we were wrong we are so sorry do not even worry about the requirements we gave you for coming back you can just come back never did though it was not only until i hit maybe 22 or 23 that it like clicked with how awful what i was doing was and started making an active effort to stop it and i feel like i was only even willing to because i fell in genuine love with somebody i was catfishing when i finally told him we were fine for a few days he told me he did not care that i was a guy because he fell in love with the person behind a screen but all of that quickly crumbled to ashes that is another one that is my own fault not only was i doing something shitty but i was also in too deep i think i still to this day get texted from somebody i started catfishing when i was about 15 or 16 that i just am too afraid to finally tell the truth to but since the recent heart break i have thankfully been able to almost entirely remove catfishing from life save for the one guy i was in too deep with and the old catfish accounts that i occasionally log into when i am desperately alonehornywhatever it may be i am tired of feeling alone i just want to be loved i want someone to want me to care about me i am starting to realize this world is awful almost every thing and everyone in it is bleak some people genuinely want to live long happy lives me personally i do not think i can make it doing this shit for another 25 years self deprecating jokes and suicidal humor are my biggest weapons because i feel like if i do not turn them into jokes i will let them overcome me too many people in this world are awful i do not want to be one anymore i doubt any of you will actually care enough to read this through but if you for some unknown reason did then i thank you because i could really use a friend tldr i am a scumbag i am starting to think my family is scumbags and i am genuinely losing my will to live i have been holding on to grudges that are literally consuming me and transforming me into a being of hatred and it makes me sick to my stomach i do not know how much longer i can do this but god i would absolutely love to just be taken out by a bus tomorrow
1,i need help i do not know what to do this is a throwaway account i am utterly embarrassed with myself i am young and have so much i feel like i can accomplish i am sitting here at work writing this and currently having on of the worst days of my life i feel alone i feel unable to connect i am isolated i feel like nobody understands i do not blame anyone for not understand maybe i am wrong i just want to feel better to feel connected i want to care about something other than myself i do not even know where to begin i am in a position where i believe there is so much negativity in my life it effects my internal optimism the real me is so much different than me i do not know how to explain that i do not know if others feel that way too there is the you who tries to be compassionate and caring but then deep down there is a different you i have such a hard time expressing myself because i feel like nobody cares how others feel you know why i feel like this i do not care how others feel well i kind of do let me put it like this let us say there is a guy i know called bob he tells me about his problems and how hard is life is i tell him that really sucks and i understand what i am going through and suddenly he feels better now that he is had someone to vent to but the reason i am trying to comfort him is not because i care about his issues i do not understand the pain he is going through the reason i comfort him is because i understand that connecting to someone in that way can be relieving it makes you feel like your not the only one going through that but what if that is just what everyone does that is how i feel about venting even though i am sitting here typing to you you probably do not care and even though you may write something that is supposed to be comforting it is not i do not believe you i cannot honestly believe that the person you are talking to that you actually care for that person i do not know if that is true or not but my deep down me says it is true i have contemplated several reasonings to why i feel so i do not know how to describe it i do not trust anyone but myself i cannot express enough how hard it is for me to put these feelings into words when i was growing up i had terrible parents no they did not hit me or physically abuse me they did not play with my mind or do some of the terrible things you hear about so why do i say there were terrible parents they were not there they were but they were not all i ever remember is my mother coming home after we went to bed i remember my dad sitting in his room watching tv we never went out we never vacationed i do not feel like i know those people i feel isolated once i reached high school things changed a bit my parents split to no surprise from anyone my dad and i lived together and got somewhat closer i wanted to live with my mom but my sister did too and i did not want my dad to have to live alone my dad was going through a deep depression at the time we would both stay home at night we did not do anything i got the new cod black ops i start skipping school nothing feels good nothing feels right i just want to play video games it is the only thing that takes me away it is the only thing i look forward too i start skipping more i never make it to class after lunch anymore principal calls my dad to setup a meeting i have missed over 80 days of school i am not going to be a freshman next year i used to be a straight a student in middle school i still think i could be i go through half of sophomore year with the same exact issues still skipping school i know it is not the right thing to do but i hurt i do not care i want to escape we move across the country for a new start my dad and i move in with his mother my grandpa recently passed so she was quite lonely also my dad is a mamas boy for sure so this helped him out too i went to a new school had a new start i meet somebody the first of day she came up to me and started talking this is the first time anyone has ever reached out to me like that i feel different i feel confident maybe people do like me turns out we go to the same church we are in the same ward the same classes she is amazing i meet another guy he is so cool he is extremely outgoing and we also go the same church the same school have some of the same classes both of them start dating i am absolutely crushed i feel alone i thought i found some people i could connect with but then puppy love takes over and once again i am ignored i meet her best friend she is kind of cute and she really likes me ok what the hell let us give it a shot we start dating i think i like her let us makeout and hangout we should have sex sex is so cool oh you do not want to that is okay we can just start slow everytime she comes over it is the same thing puppy love she starts to take notice that the relationship is very onesided i am oblivious i want sex i want attention i want to feel normal but i cannot take this stress she is causing me we are over i am done with you i do not feel bad about it then my two new friend that were together break up i do not want to step on my friends toes so i do not make any moves but she is amazing i actually care for her we start hanging out everday when they breakup i want to be with her i feel like at times she feels the same but at other times there is nothing she starts smoking cigarettes and this destroys me she is relieving stress and i do not care i just want to be there with her things escalate we get very close i feel like i can tell her anything things heat up sexually we constantly tease each other then she got a job and everything changed she met a guy we were not official or anything but i thought we were close i just do not know how to express how i feel to her and i feel like i am a backup to her maybe i was maybe i was not she starts dating this new guy he is a bad influence he smokes and drinks and he is been to jail but the thing is care for her and i do not want to stand in the way of them being together so we revert back to friends there is no issue between us three they let me hang out with them whenever the guy likes me we smoke together one night they were at a park drinking they wanted to go home and he got in his truck he hit someone they were instantly killed he is running from police she gets out of the car he crashes into a park i cannot believe it she is pregnant i cannot deal with this a girl i work with tells me about a stoner friend she has she thinks we would like each other the three of us decided to hang out that night everything goes real smoothly i genuinely enjoy this girls company the three of us go to my house and watch some movies i get her friends number i invite her to hangout that night again she sneaks out and comes over to my house at late at night we are hanging out and she makes a move things escalate and next thing i know my virginity is gone it is clear she had already lost hers our relationship quickly turns sexual she wants to fuck all the time i am not looking for sexual relationship deep down but the cool me that i want everyone to know and like does want to fuck it is cool it is what happy people do this is a normal relationship we get walked in on doing oral by her moms boyfriend he hates me i am a bad influence on her we keep seeing each other i start to really like the nonsexual part of our relationship her parents are not home and i go to see her she has to meet up with them in a few hours and they will not be coming home until after that meetup uh oh someone just came home quick hide next to my bed i have to leave right now do not worry whoever just came home is probably leaving soon too just leave after they leave so there i lay waiting for them to leave suddenly the door opens it is the boyfriend he checks the room and finds me he does not let me leave he says i am trespassing i tell him i was invited in and told to hide there he does not believe me he does not let me pass i try to push my way through and he threatens to call the cops this is bullshit i push through him and run downstairs to leave fuck her i cannot believe she put me through that she should have taken the heat i start developing anxiety from that experience i have never had anxiety i did not know anxiety existed until that point i never want to hear from her again but i really liked her i need to get out of here fuck this place fuck this town i am tired of it i want to move back to where i came from at least i know area and hey weed is legal there so at least i got something that will help me so i tell everyone that i am leaving nobody tries to stop me i have 300 in savings and plane ticket i have no where to stay i just know i want to leave i am saving goodbye to some friends and my brother comes down we are half brothers and his dad was black so he drives down to hang out with me i did not know this at the time but he is running from the cops he was a warrant out in our home state he waits outside my house at the park next door till i wakeup to tell me that he is here someone calls the cop to complain someone is trying to take a bath in the community pool he was sitting a couple 100 feet away from the pool doing nothing the cops show up and he tells the officer that he is waiting for me i learn that someone called the cops on him for sitting in the park those fucking racist neighbors just because he is black does not mean he is homeless i talk to the cop but deny him being my brother at first because i did not want to identify myself i was scared the cop harasses both us one of us is lying but we committed no real crime so he let us us go i say hey let us go smoke some weed with my friend so i drive his car over to my friends house and we light up then we decided to go to my other friends house so we leave my friends neighborhood we are being followed but i did not realize this at the time we get to a three way intersection i take a right and pull into the second lane because i have to take an immediate left after i pull over to next to the side walk and park i start unbuckling and next thing i know there is a cop next to my window he yells at me to roll down the window the window does not work i try to yell this through the door he tells me to open the door i comply i am literally shaking we have dabs in the car and a little bit of bud i am scared he says he smells marijauna as soon as i open the door bullshit he is lying the bud is in a mason jar and the dabs have no smell unless your nose is right up to it he takes everyone out of his vehicle and starts by harassing me i know you have weed in there so just let me know where it is and this will all be over we do not mind calling the k9 unites to search your car and we probably will not stop them if they try to bite you in the ass i tell them where everything is i was scared they start harassing my brother we do not want your kind in this city leave and do not come back he is black is that the kind your talking about are you fucking kidding me right now do you fucking hear yourself we are taken into custody and driven to the police station they take our pictures tell us how wrong we were no we were not doing anything wrong you guys profiled us and followed us out of one of the poorest neighborhoods in a very wealthy city you harassed us and assumed we had weed on us despite any evidence other than coming out of a poor neighborhood does not matter i have a plane ticket and i am already leaving i arrive in this new city and hit up a craiglist contact i reached out to earlier we are in similar positions he is a year older just moved to chicago he is very forward about the fact that he is homosexualwe will call him bradley okay no problem i figure he realizes i am not interested he offers me a place to stay with i am for 300 perfect that is all i have i get a job at a local pizza place it is perfect because i can make tips to help me until next paycheck now i have no money turns out it is not his house but we are sharing his room in a house which other people from chicago the other people are great but they hate bradley bradley is a douche bradley suggest i might be a closet homosexual he will have sex with me if i want but he let us me know he would be the top he tells other people that i am actually a 32 year old pretending to be 19 he tells other people i am hiding my homosexuality he constantly describes homo sex to me i do not want to hear about it i tell him i do not care who he likes what gender he is i do not want to hear about his sex life he continues to harass me sexually i ask the other roommates if i can take the extra room upstairs i will pay for a fair share of the rent they all hate bradley and they agree it is a shitty house and i want to move out i want to move closer to work i isolate myself further all these new people this is a new life i am on my own now nobody is going to help me i find a roommate and we get a small apt to share i quit the pizza place after some bullshit that i am over with bad management that blames the staff for everything just one example there was a busy wednesday night where i was the only server the ice cream machine breaks and i am usually the one to fix it i do not have time as i am serving everyone i am supposed to clean it every night we usually have two servers on a busy night like this i finally finish serving and cleaning up and at that point it is midnight i have to back at 1pm the next day for lunch rush i am exhausted from covering another servers shift i put a note on the ice cream machine not to turn it on as it is broken skip forward to 8 am when the owner blows up my phone because the ice cream machine was not cleaned properly last night and once he turned it on ice cream starting spilling everywhere are you fucking kidding me can you fucking read i come in to see the damage and i see the note still on the ice cream machine he says he saw the note but does not tell me anything more than that he did not tell me why he decided to turn it on regardless of the note he yells at me for not staying later than i did even though i already worked an hour and a half past my get off time while working two fucking shifts long story short his wife told me she did not have time to fix my paycheck with 10 overtime hours fucking missing off my paycheck fuck you bitch you do not deserve me as an employee and i walk out i then find the job opportunity of my life a web design firm is hiring okay awesome let me just apply and show them all my awesome skills i walk in to the interview everything is brand new everyone is dressed super nice everyone is super young i start and 3 days after being hired my supervisor is fired for nodding out i should have seen this sign and left right then and there the owner starts talking to me more and more he gives me special jobs and has talks with me all the time it is clear he is doing some sort of drugs over the next few months and many raises later things start going really downhill this guy starts playing mind games with everyone someone is stealing is leads someone is always out to get him he wants to know who is stabbing him in the back he sets up elaborate traps to catch people in the act he ends up accusing me of stealing leads that is impossible i would never do that he sets it up so that i end up blaming another one of his top guys but if you look at all the evidence he planted he made it look like it was that guy who was stealing the leads so then he accuses me because of the accusations i made about his top guy this is some bullshit he calls me that night because he wants me to admit to it i go off him i have never felt so betrayed in my life i told him how bullshit it is that he is accusing me of lying to him he just lyed to me about all the evidence that made me accuse the other guy he says it is going to be ok and he forgives me he just wants me to tell him that it was me and it will all be over no fuck you it was not me go fuck yourself he contacts me the next day when i do not show up for work he says come hangout with me i just want to talk we go to the bank with another guy and spend a couple hours there opening up a new business account everything is going fine i am explaining to him how betrayed i felt he apologizes and says it will not happen again then he decides he will take me home he pulls over the side of the road on the way home and crushes what appears to be 2 30mg percs and 2 lines of cocoa snorts that shit right up on the side of the fucking road i feel unsafe i want to leave this company never see this guy again and i do leave fuck this industry i want to make my own company and what do you know i isolate myself deeper i cannot trust anybody they will just end up fucking you i get 3 other friends together as business partners the only way i can describe the next 6 months is us pretending to be a company it is like when you were five and playing company with your little five year old friends we had meetings and sale pitches and presentations to potential clients but we never actually did any real nitty gritty work we played company for six months took in over 40k and spent all of it every customer charged back on us for not doing anything and that company went bankrupt very quickly at this point i had wasted a significant portion of savings trying to survive so now i was slightly in debt with no job only thing to do is to start my own company my own i am the boss i take everything i learned from my previous experiences i rely on already established relationships for work i get enough freelance work to support myself and the company i am working over 50 hours a week just to keep my company afloat it is worth it to me i do not want anyone taking advantage of me i am done with the bullshit i am done with people fucking me i am done so how does this all affect me now why do i feel more lost than i ever have been you know how someone is knowledgeable in a subject it is when they realize that no matter how much they study and learn they will never learn everything about the subject that realization in a person shows wisdom in that subject maybe that is how i feel about life at this point i will never truly get the point i want to be at and the reason i know that is from all the past experiences i have had i am scared i am anxious i am stressed i am alone i do not know how to connect with anyone i do not trust anyone i am alone i am isolated i am scared and i do not know what to do nobody in my life at the moment is my age there is nobody i can come home to no friends or girlfriends nothing i am alone i work more hours than i want to i am dying i did not take care of my teeth as an adolescent my teeth are practically falling out i have three molars that have practically decayed but i do not have enough money to do anything about it i am still recovering from the debt i have accrued my car literally broke down two days ago after just fixing it i literally have not even paid off my last car billcost me 700 which put me into debt again now i need to pay around another 1000 just get it driveable again there is nobody to tell this too nobody is willing to help me i am going to lose my clients not being able to transport myself to their places of business i am fucked i got fucked i am absolutely alone if you have read this far i want you to know i am not asking for money here please do not offer i am not here for monetary gain i do not know what i am here for i am sitting at my home office right now and my teeth hurt so fucking bad right now i wish i could just hug someone right now anybody i wish i could feel some level of comfort when all i want to do is to lay down and cry and as i write what i determine to be the last few thoughts of my ventilation tears are slowly rolling down my eyes i do not think i can press submit but it feels good to have these feelings come out of me i do not feel like there is anybody i could tell all of this too which is why i am writing this right now i do not want anybody to try and help i do not know if i can press submit now it makes me feel like a burden i do not want to be a burden i am just going to do it maybe somebody out there can she would some light for me
1,i am 19 my girlfriend was murdered the trial is soon and i am getting more and more depressive hi you all well i am not used to posting on forums but i feel so bad atm and i cannot open up about this to my family my friends or my therapist even if they want that i feel completely unable to talk about it with them i am a 20yo man im irish but my family moved to france when i was 5 and that is where i have lived since i grew up in a small country village the school had only two classes i hardly spoke french but i got a friend very quickly i will call her honey in this post so honey and i were friends all our childhood we were in the same class every year and we were also neighbors so we played together every day after school year after year i became bilingual in french and made lots of friends but i started to have a crush on her when i was 11 we started middle school we were still in the same class and all our classmates were trying to get us together but we were pretty shy at that time so we did not dare to flirt finally it was the following year when i was 12 years old that we got in relationship of course the feelings i had for her were not as strong as those i had for her when we grew up up because we were still young but i was so happy she was the first girl i kissed the only one actually we kept growing up we were always in the same class every year and we kept spending all of our time together if i explain that it is so that you understand that from my 5 to 19 years i almost spent every day of my life with her she gradually became as essential as breathing for me the more the years went by the more seriousimportant to each of us our relationship became we never argue of course sometimes we did not agree with each other but we knew how to put our differences aside and respect the point of view of the other then when i was 15 we started high school at that time we were in a relationship for almost three years and people were amazed by the longevity of our couple because at that age it is unusual but we loved each other so much and i still love her so much it was like i had found the perfect person to me and i do not want to speak for her but i felt like i was perfect to her we kept growing up we did our first time together and all the others i never had sex with another girl we wrote long love letters to each other any pretext was good to say how much we loved each other i mean i am kind of that clich of the chunk rugby player people do not really imagine me doing that yet for her id have done anything and everything she was so exceptional i felt incredibly privileged to be part of her life we graduated high school and that summer we moved into our apartment then started university i was so glad to live with her to sleep with her every night of course our parents let us sleep together on weekends and holidays but it was not the same it was a new step in our relationship and we were so happy when i explained to my new mates from the university that i had been with my girlfriend for 6 years they were stunned they asked me if i had never wanted to flirt with another girl or anything and the answer has always been no since my childhood i grew up alongside this exceptional girl and i always dreamed of being with her and i felt so lucky to be in a relationship with i never even noticed any other girl i found her perfect in every way we were so happy i just want to tell you a little bit about the great person she was she was so heart warmed she could not stand injustice she always wanted to help others she was so kind and caring whenever our friends needed advice or support for something she was the one they call she was full of wisdom and good intentions she was always smiling she illuminated peoples lives with her presence she was a very funny person as well she always saw the bright side of everything she was so positive she never gave up she worked hard to reach her goals she was so clever i would even say brilliant she was a very gifted student she was passionate when she did something she put her whole heart into it she made people feeling special she knew how to bring out the best in them she always complimented everyone she was adorable she was also sensitive she hated seeing the ugly things of the world she could cry for that but she was also someone who made the world more beautiful by her mere presence i have never met someone so selfless and altruistic she was also incredibly beautiful the most beautiful woman i have ever seen she was an angel for her friends for her family for me for my family who loved her too my mam has three sons and she was used to say that honey was like her daughter my little brother was kind of an hooligan when he was younger and listened neither to my parents nor to me she spent so much time helping him because of her he really took control of his life again everyone loved her literally she was wonderful she was someone who loved to pamper people she could spend weeks making a gift or a surprise for someone but she was always embarrassed when someone gived a gift to her i think she was one of the few people who was sincere when they said they preferred to give than to receive i felt so good with her she was the love of my life literally i always wondered how she could love me so much i mean im not that bad and i always did my best especially for her but she was so much better than me and yet she still looked at me like i was one of the wonder of the world we were so happy i was only 19 years old and yet i saw my life with her and she saw her life with me we had lots of plans and even beyond me she was a great person who was so young and had her life ahead of her i mean if we had broken up it would have been incredibly hard but at least she would have kept existing living shining as she deserved but i cannot bear what happened we were together so happy and in love i never could have believed that she will disappear so quickly and in such a brutal way no one deserves that and when it happens to someone so close to you someone you love so much it is extremely harsh it was a sunday and we were at our parents for the weekend sometimes on weekends we slept together and sometimes we slept on our own and we just spent the day together on saturday evening we slept each on our own her at her parents and me at mine there was not even a particular reason on sunday morning she wanted to run for an hour and offered me but i was lazy i was tired i wanted to stay in bed an hour more it is absurd i was studying sports science and i was too lazy to go running id never forgive myself it is an ongoing case so i am not allowed to speak in detail about it and anyway it does not have to be but she was violently assaulted and tortured and died and then her body was burned suspects were arrested a few weeks later it was in feb 2019 and the trial was supposed to be in may 2020 but it was postponed because of the coronavirus france is in quarantine i cannot even describe the infinite pain i felt when a few days after his disappearance while very important research was being carried out her body was finally found and we knew what had happened to her i had a blackout since i woke up from this fading away i have been taking heavy psychotropes that does not prevent me from constantly having anxiety attacks and having to take a fuck ton of sleeping pills to sleep otherwise i have awful nightmares i never thought ill fall so low one day i have always been someone very happy and fullblown but i never thought that the love of my life was going to be murdered one day either i have not been going to university since i do not do anything except think about her all day i saw a lot of therapist but they only say shit how am i supposed to accept the sudden death of the person i love the most in the world and with whom i grew up believing that we were going to spend our lives together they tell me about the emotions of mourning but the only emotions i have are deep feelings of hopelessness and hatred towards those who did this i feel even worse since i know who did this and what their reasons were because they were people i knew i feel devastated sometimes i want to kill myself and sometimes i want to avenge her by killing them but i feel unable to inflict this pain on my parents who are very friends with honeys parents they had been friends for a long time before because we are neighbors and who help them a lot to hold on since it happened i can see that they have the fear is that i kill myself and to be in the same state as the parents of honey her parents are suffering so much they lost their only daughter and i do not know what to do to relieve their pain whenever i speak with them they seem so happy all of a sudden they say that honey kept living through me but i am going to it is not true she no longer lives and will never lives again and i miss her so so much but i know if they say that it is because they miss her so much too she is missed by everyone who knew her she was so wonderful and i will always miss her people tell me that one day when i will be happy again and ill meet someone else and go back to normal life but i know it is wrong first ill never be happy again how am i supposed to live without her after growing up with her she was as essential to me as breathing it is unbearable to survive since shes no longer there how can i resume a normal life and how can i meet someone else i never wanted when i was happy and she was there to meet someone else so it is not now that im desperate without her that ill want to meet someone plus she is irreplaceable i feel devastated she is the only one i want and yet i know shell never come back i constantly think of her of her laughter her smile her scent i bought her perfume and i spray it on my pillow every day i know it is stupid but it is the only thing that helps me sleep a little better i just want to hug her again sometimes when people lose a loved one they say they regret not telling them how much they mean to them and at least i am relieved that honey knew how much i loved her and how important she was to me when she passed away because i told her every day just before the quarantine there was a commemoration for the one year of her death and everyone looked at me with pity as i no longer go to class in rugby or to see my friends i do not see anyone and i had not seen some people for several months they were dazed by my appearance and i had not realized but actually i became the shadow of myself i always was very strong and now im extremely bony it depressed me even more to see how many people seemed concerned when they saw me that is why i avoid my friends they do not know what to say and i understand that is normal in their place i would not know what to say either and theyre also embarrassed not to know what to tell me the only person i used to open up to is honey and now having to deal with such difficult emotions without knowing to who open up is very painful my family is trying to support me as much as they can but it is very hard there was a very bad atmosphere at home so much so that my parents broke up and my father went back to ireland with my older brother i feel like my mom and little brother do not know what to do with me anymore but i do not know what to do with me either i think that after the trial ill go to ireland for a while as well just to take a break here every time i go out everyone is aware of what happened throughout the region and even outside but here they recognize me so they look at me with that pitying air that depresses me even more i am not afraid of the judgement i know theyll have a long sentence but im very afraid of the trial in itself and to during a week or two to hear what she has been through in detail all day to see her murderers and to hear what theyre going to say im anxious i cannot bear it for the moment i am trying not to think about it i spend all my time in the tree hut that his father built between our gardens when we were younger we spent all our time there when we were teenagers and our parents did not want us to sleep together we secretly met there and stayed all night everything remained as it is when i am there i feel calmer i feel like nothing can ever ease my pain i do not even know why i came to tell my story here i just needed to open up and i cannot do it with my loved one i do not think anyone will have read this anyway
1,i know the post will go down here but i have serious problems i should quit my life first of all i have hesitated for a long time just to write everything that burdens me but maybe it helps just to get rid of everything once about me 31 years old i am psychologically completely broken and physically unfortunately also very lediert my life has just gone wrong from the beginning and sometimes i wonder if some people are just lucky and others are not i grew up in an already broken family my mother was married 3x and divorced 3x i am the child of the second husband i can remember almost all the incidents of my childhood which makes it worse for me one of the first memories i have about 35 years my father went after my mother with a knife and even stabbed through a door with a knife he was then thrown out by my grandparents and i saw him only once a short time later he was an alcoholic all his life and did not even try to contact me even when my exwife met him by chance in the hospital 10 years ago and gave him my cell phone number without my knowledge in the meantime he passed away about 2 months ago and i knew nothing about him except that he was an alcoholic after he was no longer there my mother had quickly met someone new my stepfather he was 8 years younger than my mother unfortunately he was also very aggressive as a chain smoker he was very quickly annoyed when he had no more cigarettes and has quickly become with things around him it also did not take long and my mother and he have often and loudly quarreled often thrown on dishes on the walls he became unfortunately also now and then handgreiflich and has beaten me and my brother whereby my brother was rather his favorite since he was older and could make more with him after we have moved several times we lived in a townhouse only then it did not take long that my mother and my stepfather have also divorced my stepfather had cheated on my mother for a long time with my cousin yes it does not get better after the separation my stepfather has emptied the joint account and has filed for bankruptcy because no one could keep the house alone my mother also had to file for bankruptcy shortly after that we moved of course unfortunately my mother lost her job 3 years later and has never found a fulltime job again and lives since then on social benefits with my brother child of my first husband and 3 years older than me i never had a really good relationship mostly he did not want to have anything to do with me and we generally did less together he was also not at the same school as me he was never very educated unfortunately he also moved out quite early because he did not get along with our mother at all and even resented that she separated from our stepfather because he got along with him he then moved to another cousin of ours until he was 18 and even had contact with our stepfather generally he was always very strange he watched our parents having sex or generally our mother taking a shower and played with himself while doing so he is also said to have had sex with our cousin according to a friend of his probably several times and has often set fire with a friend together he somehow had a kind of mother complex and for many years always looked for much older women who often also had children but usually it did not last very long when it was over he often set a fire somewhere what i knew about afterwards was his own car a garden she would a meadow and finally an attic of an apartment building whereupon he was arrested and sentenced however only on probation his last partner was 11 years older than him with whom he actually held out for 6 years only a short time later he had a partner 11 years younger a complete change of heart which was then suddenly pregnant immediately after the first child a few weeks later she was pregnant again however i had in the people 10 years very very rarely contact with my brother and we have seen us actually only when our grandparents died who have reached a proud age 92 and 94 in general i have also completely broken off contact in the meantime because after several attempts on my part no normal relationship can develop between us i can not even have a reasonable conversation with him because you just notice he seems to be very stupid i just can not express it differently about me i also made a lot of mistakes in life unfortunately for me i almost did not focus on my schooling and did almost nothing in class my mom did not care what i did or did not do anyway she never showed up for a parentteacher conference either i wanted to earn money as fast as possible and learned the next best thing and ended up in the camp my goal though was to become a soldier and joined the army after my training unfortunately i got a slipped disc there and dropped out 2 years later then i ended up in a larger company where i had worked until today i started drinking myself very early 15 years because i myself had a very bad environment the city i lived in generally had high unemployment and there was a lot of drug dealing also through my education i drank almost every day after work and it was later to the point that i completely shut down 4 times a week and had a blackout several times this was no better in the armed forces was able to make the leap in my mid 20s though and quit i do not even drink beer in between anymore because i just do not feel like it i also take my other drugs although i sometimes wonder if maybe i should or smoke either i have always tried in my life to escape into some relationships because i could not be alone my first relationship lasted 5 years circa and i was married myself and had to divorce and have a son my exwife however always wanted to make life difficult for me and i got deeply into debt because of her since she among other things never completed an education just like that she quit her jobs and i was the sole breadwinner and often signed contracts and did not pay them whereupon i received debt collection letters i had to declare insolvency at some point because we also had a joint loan running i had also met a new woman half a year later and moved only my exwife really sabotaged this relationship and it did not last long also because i wanted to see my son regularly i then decided to stay alone for 2 years but lived near my exwife again because of my son when i met my current partner i decided to finally live my own life and not always be there for others and moved a little further away got another wonderful daughter and everything looked like it was going uphill also this time my exwife has tried to make our life hell which led to the fact that i have quarreled with my partner very often and now also have no contact with my son for a year my job has also deteriorated more and more because the company was bought up 3x and changed the work climate has made me more and more broken and i had a second herniated disc in addition i was then admitted to a day clinic because i was also psychologically at the end after a few months there i was diagnosed with trauma therapy and was also diagnosed with bipolar narcism i discontinued this therapy a year later because it did not help me at all in the meantime however i have screwed everything up i had to give up my job for health reasons although i have a gdb of 30 and was equalized i am also about to lose my partner because there is more and more crisis between us i really do not have anyone in my life anymore i have moved 13 times in my life in general and have lost a lot of contacts and friends i also lost some contacts because of my exwife i generally only have contact with some friends i met online or old work colleagues i also see my mother about 12 times a year but i do not care if i see her at all or not but she understandably wants contact with her grandchildren i must also say to myself i was a very difficult personality from a certain point and also my friends and partners had to learn to deal with it i always had the urge to somehow talk nonsense and can hardly ever stay serious about anything even when i write this text you could subordinate it under joke addiction or moria i also have a very low frustration threshold and go crazy quickly if i just drop something unfortunately i am also very forgetful and often do not know what i am supposed to do several times a day i probably owe that to the alcohol all in all due to narcism i often have the impression of being emotionally dead i cry in the rarest situation at all even if sad videos still carry me away i can hardly show empathy towards others i also really do not care about much and i notice it more and more that i really do not care about anything that happens apart from my children i have never really had the feeling of being happy in general almost nothing good has ever happened to me conclusion so now i wonder does it even make sense for me to exist i am insolvent i have a divorce behind me my partner will leave me soon i have no job anymore no friends and probably soon no more apartment since i then the insolvent also no new apartment more find edit first of all thank you all you have really touched my heart even if it is hard for me to admit something like that you do not have to worry about me doing anything to myself i do not want my children to have a horrible childhood like me besides for your love you are really great and i understood that there are things in life worth living for of course i will also seek professional help it is not very easy to get appointments here but i will keep at it and not give up i know i cannot change my past but i can change my future my inbox has exploded with messages and i have already replied to some even if i wanted to i probably will not manage to reply to every single one thanks again you are great and stop pls giving me reward save your money smiling_face red_heart
1,i am tired of being everyone is therapist when no one will give me ten serious minutes of their time i have had a bunch of stuff happen to me in the past month i got appendicitis and surgery still recovering accidentally twisted my ankle i got a cold which i am still fighting however none of that seemed to be enough for people to give me a break from emotional labor they demand it from me 247 practically not asking for advice really just ranting these are just a few examples i had my sister calling me talking about her boyfriend who just drinks all the time and does nothing and she was complaining about how she hates where she works i tell her to get rid of the man and get a job somewhere else it was not as short as it sounds i listened to her and gave her serious advice though i know she will not take it because she never does instead of thanking me no one ever does she tells me that it is easy for me to tell her to just get another job because i do not have one and can just sit around and sleep well thanks i just love sitting around and thinking about my crappy life it is a positive joy we had not spoken until her son ended up in an issue and of course the family therapist me gets a text asking me to talk to her son and try to get him to listen to reason i agree just because i know my nephew does not get good support from her come to find out she is mad because he is dating some girl who has a kid already i cannot say it is great at his age but he is also an adult so i just told him to be careful watch out for emotional abuse and reminded him of his last relationship which was like a copy of his moms relationships she does not realize he gets his bad examples from her after talking to him his mom texts me and is like i am getting off work in a few hours i will call and we can do a threeway call and talk to him nowhere did she ask me if this was okay did not ask if i was busy or anything but as with most of my family since i am at home i never have anything important to do so they just tell me to do stuff instead of asking like i am a human being i tell her i texted him and i was still recovering and needed to sleep she did not ask me what i was recovering from if i was okay nothing just said okay night my niece had trouble at school and she is a lot like my sister unable to let go of things she is upset because some girl at school wants to fight her because my niece took her chair a chair this girl was not using mind you but that was just sitting next to her my niece calls me upset and frantic over this because the girl will not let it go and went to the office and had my niece called out of class because the girl wanted an apology my niece refused because she said she had not even done anything and she went to the principal who told her that the girl is known for keeping things going so she would not be bothered again but my niece would not get off the phone until i promised to stay up until she got out of school in case they call her into the office again and she wanted me to talk to them a huge reason i do not have kids is so i do not have to deal with the stress of dealing with teachers and other parents yet i have to be a parent to my niece because my sister will not be mind you i had just come back from the doctor had been hopped up on pain meds and wanted to do nothing but sleep i forced myself to stay awake but thankfully no one called then my sister calls me and is crying telling me how much she wants her boyfriend to leave the house so i do not say anything and just let her talk finally she is like i just do not know what to do or how to get him out of my house i told her to call the police she does not want to get him in any more trouble because he has a dui because he drinks and drives she allows him to drink and drive her car because he does not have one and does not have a license i will not even touch how stupid that is so i get frustrated with her and tell her that i keep telling her how to get rid of him and she never listens so i do not know what she wants me to do she acts like i offended her and is like i just called to vent cannot i vent sometimes i tell her that she can but i am tired of getting calls almost every week about this man i am not her therapist or life coach or anything i am barely hanging on by a thread a lot of days and hearing about this situation distresses me because even if i do not like her very much i do not want to hear about anyone dealing with this type of stuff not to mention her best friend was killed just a few months ago by her boyfriend who was abusive and drunk a lot make him leave before he gets to that point anyway she accuses me of making it about me and hangs up maybe i did make it about me but i want people to understand that i am not a therapist and i cannot fix their issues and i am not emotionally well enough to take on all this stuff i am not sure anyone is to be honest finally we come to today my mother had to take me to the doctor because i could not get there on my own and need support to get there we are talking about normal stuff then she is like are not you tired of just sitting at home and doing nothing you really need to get out and get a life i do not ever like talking to my mom about my mental health because she acts like it is a phase that should have been over in my teens and she does not understand why i am letting it bother me as an adult i would like to mention she has horrible anxiety as well but she powers through it to work at least it still takes over her life she also does not do much outside of the house and has no life but when i point that out she brings it back to me anyway i tell her i just paid all the bills and since the bills got higher i do not have money to have a life even if i wanted to so then she is like if you get a job you would have more money i know this but i have tried many times to hold a job i cannot do it for more than a few days without having panic attacks and breakdowns which either end up with me leaving or getting let go which then leads me into a deep depression she acts like i do not try and this is even with medicine and therapy sometimes i am sure the main reason none of this works is because i am around my family but i never tell them that because i do not want to deal with that fallout at this point i am just tired of the conversation so i do not respond then she brings up how i need to get some friends at least says the woman who literally has one friend and who got upset at my aunt for going out without her even though she never goes anywhere when she invites her heavy eyeroll anyway i tell her that i have tried to have friends it is not my fault they do not put effort in and either they end up not talking or i fade out because nothing is happening she asks me why i do not hang out with the people i met last summer the two girls i met last summer were nice but one would rarely go out with us because she would rather stay in with her boyfriend which left me and the other girl we hung out a few times but then she got a new trivia group and stopped texting me back so i stopped texting her and let that fade out this happens too often so i stopped trying to make friends i tell my mom that i do not talk to them anymore and she is like that is your problem you do not try and cut people off so quickly i texted the second girl every day for a week she was not working at the time and she was always posting snaps so i knew she was available i was not going to keep texting for no reason i try to have boundaries and get crapped on for them unfortunately i am not one of those people who will keep trying and trying and trying when i see things obviously are not going along anymore she then goes into this long story about how she met her only friend and how they only talk like once a month but they are still good friends and i need to be more realistic with friends what good is a friend whom i only talk to for 10 minutes once a month and hang out with maybe once every three months if that works for her great but that is not getting a life or anything else plus i have a history of getting friends and then i become the therapy friend and i fade away because all they ever do is come around to dump their problems on me and get advice then i do not hear from them for months when something else is going wrong that is not friendship to me and go back to my mom and my aunt my aunt is mad at my mom for checking up on her at her age and of course i get pulled into it because my mom is being childish and will not talk to my aunt so i have been designated the gobetween but i never said i would be they are 20 years older than me why am i even in this i do not know i am just tired of being everyone is therapist and mediator i keep trying to explain how draining it is they obviously see i have my own issues but they continually pour their issues onto me expect sincere helpful empathetic responses but let me feel bad or need something and everyone is busy or does not answer their phones or i get advice that is not helpful my niece and nephew would probably talk but i do not want to burden them with my issues their mother does that to them enough and they complain about it to me of course what is it about me that makes everyone think i am a therapist plus none of them pay me for my services that probably makes me more upset than anything if i was a real therapist i would probably be rich off all these sessions lol
1,i cannot stand it anymore i am committing suicide this is my story being good and positive will not help you stop suffering why does this happen to me honest to god i hate my life so much i am a 16 year boyi try to make every negative thing positive but it does not works so much has happen to me in the last year my parents and sister passed away in an accident last year i do not if i should feel bad since they have tortured me mentally and physically my whole life i never though much of it but once my uncle raped me at 6 and told me to shut up or he will kill me when i came of age i found out the truth i revealed it to my parents who tried to get me arrested for being mentally ill just because they wanted to save face but what has happened happened i escaped the morning after they found out and tortured me to shut upsame night they tried to get me arrested i escaped and entered foster care when i was 1314 i am in my last year in high school i have my gcse and i cannot study with due to the time limit my carer has given me and it just does not work because the house is far from my school so it takes long to travel i travel for 4 hoursmostly walkingit is 74 miles however i take multiple bus routes and walk for an hour4 hours there and back so that meant i had 8 hours to sleep or studyso i barely get any chance to revise especially since i know i am smart i got straight 7s a in my mocks before this unfolded so it is so frustrating since i did not do too well in my last mock due to my parents death a few days before my 2nd mocks started now i am struggling to stay in my high sets then there is my social life as i said it is hard to do anything since i live far my original town around an hour away side track i used to be really overweight but due me being bullied as a kid and then my crush making fun of me motivated me to lose weight age 1385kg to age 1451kg which i was proud off but that routine got destroyed due to me moving into foster i gained weight and now i am age 15 2 months away from 16 65kg and one thing that annoys me is that my aunty could have taken my she had a high paying job but she did not want to take care of kid she is married and has a child she was also a social worker however i forgot to mention it was this women this women who i confided in someone i though was my hope she was the one that betrayed me and told my parents about my uncle raping me and me wanting to move out when i turn 18 she betrayed me and made it seems as though i fabricated this lie so i could move out she promised me to wait till i turned 18 so i had a choice in my life but nope she could not wait first of all i was not the only one raped 2 other kids were also raped by him they both told my aunty but to save face they threatened the other two because they are still 11 they are more likely to listen i did not therefore the reason i was tortured i hate her with all my life my only hope turned into my biggest disappointment police gave up due to the lack of testimony whole family conspired against me in addition to my social life as i mention i was bullied my whole childhood i was a fat kid who did not know how to socialise becuz my parents always fought or let their frustration out on me mentally or physically and because i was not popular my best friend pretended not to know me in school and then supposedly wants to always hang out with me when ever there was not school i was still naive then he betrayed me twice in high school i ended our friendship 2 years ago after the 2nd time i trusted him and he betrayed me a few weeks after that i met a new person who was a really good friend that was when his cousin was not around his cousin lied framed me racist commentweird even though we are the same race but still i did not even say it i proved it a week later when he posted the wrong screenshot since we had beef showing he said it first and all i did was say the same thing backand what my friend did was support him that infuriated me since i knew he was supporting him and sat next thingwhat makes it even worse was that it was all on his phone i did not end my friendship with this person but i did drift off from him i then met a person who was a genuine nice person we had a good couple of months but his parents were strict so we could not hang out much and we have kind of drifted off but he is still someone i would trust i also met another genuine person he was a new kid and he is now my best friend i think it was weird because i never expected it to happen since he was popular i was just well a student even we are close and talk quiet a bit but i always feel uncomfortable with him he never answers me with full sentences does not talk to me when we are with out group of friends but i do know he cares for me as a friend but a lot of the time i think that if it was purely up to him and by date of chance that we say next to each other is that he never would have bothered speaking to me in fact he is probably the only one that would actually hang out with me in our group of friends the thing our group of friends are not like friend but just nice people in my perspectiveits like we are friends only when the other person is here if you get what i mean it honestly is so fucked up me i only have what like a month to my gcse and all i am is depressed down i have never once been happy this year actually that was a life the only thing that makes me happy is anime i have developed an anime addiction ever since age 8 this was originally due to my parents fighting and arguing so i went upstairs to watch movies until i stumbled onto anime the only good thing i can think of is that in 2 mo the i turn 16 which means i will be able to rent a flat thanks to my social workers i will be in a new town in a new school i will be in college and i will be able to start a fresh start but still looking how my life is it feels like i am meant to have a hard life it does not help that i am an atheist because that means i am not able to rely on someone with 100 belief i have never had a true true friend my education is pretty much ruin i am literally on my own my carer only cares about the money and my social worker cannot find any more placements it is so fucking frustrating honestly is it just that some people have a hard life i have sacrificed so many hours of sleep that my heights been affected and that i have dozed of many time on the busi just cannot care anymore all i want now is to become rich and take over the world without any selfish desires i just want to truly make this world better because it does not look like anyone is going to help me i have tried got hurtmany times and all for what edit half a year later into now january 2020in my first year of college my life has gone worse i am not in the mood to explain it somehow somehow it is gone worse i have been diagnosed with metal health disorder and no one understands me they have bad view of me and when i try to explain they place their authority over me and will not let me talk especially when i have facts my social life has not changed my genuine friend with strict parents guess what happened you would have never would have guessed face_with_rolling_eyes he spread rumours about my personal life and left me for another person i have gained weight i am back to my weight before my weight loss i am now again 85kg i did not get into the course i wanted in college becuz i was a grade behind the works easy but i cannot seems to concentrate i zone out when the teacher scolds even though i really do want to listen i do want to try i have been having mental breakdowns pretty much everydayi have been debating over the last few months to either take the drug and deep it is effect even though my studies will fail more than it already has or overdose and commit suicide i am lost i am hopeless i have got no one for me i am no one number one i am alone i got literally nothing to lose and no one benefits from me being alive it i have had enough of this bullshit life in this bullshit world i have bad luck there is no desputing that it is what it is i am committing the act on my birthday which is in june to a certain extent this is kind of funny who would have though life could get this shitty at such a young age for kid born in a good area who would have though not trying to sound pessimistic but i was genuinely kind and generous to all my friends and everyone i meet would suffer like this the good guy gets nothing wow even i cringed when i said that whatever happens in june happens if i do commit i would at least want someone to know my story and if they meet someone like me please i beg with all my life help him the one thing i wish i had was someone who understood someone who did not listen because they had but they wanted to someone who would not try to tell me to look at the positive but actually help someone who would have been my hero thank you for reading this is kukwbefore i changed my

1,i am quarantined away from my baby and my boyfriend is no help info bf has manic depression it is what he calls his diagnosis i am aware that it is called bipolar disorder now but i am respecting his label for his own mental health disorder he is on meds that he takes off an on because his sleep schedule is messed up due to a new job and he is supposed to take them every 24 hours before bed he is been off of them for 3 day i feel like he is acting like this because he is off his meds i have depression anxiety and ptsd i am on zoloft buspar and the mini pill i am currently off of the zoloft and buspar due to all of my life changes which has amped up my depression and ptsd symptoms i have run out of my mini pill which helps with anxiety so i imagine that will get worse if i cannot get a refill soon actual post hey i have to quarantine away from my baby because i am really sick and my partner tested positive i am really depressed about it and i do not know what to do to stop crying i have been crying for 2 days i feel so empty without her she is getting over rsv and has an ear infection in both ears so it is better for her to be at her fathers away from me but every instinct in my body is screaming to have her safe in my arms i just cannot stop crying i already have depression anxiety and ptsd and i think that this is feeding into those i am off my meds right now because my hospital sold my doctors practice plus i moved to a new county so i have to find a new doctor to get the right meds now that will have to wait for this quarantine i did not hug her enough before she left with him i was sick and it hurt to be touched and i just did not snuggle her enough she looked at me through facetime yesterday and cried wanting me she just kept reaching for me through the phone and did not understand why i could not hold her i am also dealing with jealousy because my exs new girlfriend is seeing her everyday and getting to love on her and hold her and play with her i know that it is selfish but this girl wants to be a mother badly and it feels as if she is stealing my baby i know that she is not stealing her but it feels that way i just want her home how am i supposed to do 10 days of this how am i supposed to go from seeing holding her and loving on her everyday to not at all this is so hard my boyfriend has 3 kids that he is across the country from so he is desensitized to it for him it is been his life for 2 years so he does not understand why it is such a big deal he just wants me to magically get better he has his own depression and says that it is not good for him to be around someone so depressed which is valid but it still hurts to hear he says that i need to work harder to fix it he says that i am not working hard enough i do not know what he wants me to do in isolation that i have not been doing for years already i have been suicidally depressed since i was a little girl due to be in an abusive home i have been to numerous healthcare professionals and on multiple meds and combinations of meds for years it is not an overnight fix and i do not think that he understands that he wants me to reach out to people around me and people on facebook and stuff but i do not talk about my mental health issues with people when i have tried in the past people just treated me like i was crazy or expected it to be fixed overnight or very quickly blamed every little thing they did not like about me on my mental illnesses and then dumped me because of them i became stigmatized very quickly and i hated it it is embarrassing to talk about in general a lot of people depend on me and this shows me as being a undependable person that is how i get treated when i mention it at least he openly talks about his mental health to anyone who listens and i worry that he burdens others with it and i do not want to burden others too that gets exhausting for people very quickly he said that reaching out like that is what will fix it quicker though i do not know why i am just an object to be fixed to him when he keeps asking how we can fix it i just want to scream like am i not allowed to just feel it for a second can i not just be sad for a couple days then move on from it and that be okay why is it wrong for me to just cope with it in my own way he asked for me to be more emotional i am usually a very logical person as a defense mechanism to hide this part of myself and protect it i do not show emotions to anyone he asked me to because he hated that logical defense mechanism he broke those walls down i warned him about this multiple times he said that he could handle it now every time i have any emotion whether it is excitement happiness anger or depression he says that it is too much for him to handle he distances himself from me i tried to express that to him and he actively denied doing it he said that he is just communicating it is great that he is but he is confirming that i am a burden by doing that why ask me to be emotional if you cannot take those emotions on why offer support only to wrench it away so suddenly when i need it most he is so supportive and loving with all of his friends and takes every emotion of theirs in stride with his own he sometimes puts me on the back burner to do so why can he do that with them but not me why can he just so readily be there like he promised without trying to just fix everything but not do that for me why am i just something to be fixed why am i the one that is too much for him he says that i am sad all the time i pointed out that the majority of time that i am chipper and happy and high energy and he hates that he says that it is too much which forces me to either be neutral or have a negative emotion he just brushed by that statement and never addressed it like what does he want from me here i feel like i cannot win i am just struggling and need someone and he promised to be that someone and now it feels like he is dropped me in an ocean after trying to rescue me from it and i am drowning i want to go back to not feeling but he hates that too i asked him what the point of me being here is then i asked him what i do for him he says that i give him something to look forward to when he wakes up in the morning i do not know what to do with that it makes me feel like a warm body to just fill space he says that he is not ready to go full on commitment and be super serious but we have moved in together in his place because he thought that it would be a good idea we said i love you only for him to recently admit that he said that out of an intimate love for me but he is not in love with me he does not want to be serious but then he keeps trying to break down my walls and expects me to just pour all of my emotions out to him even though he cannot handle it he does not want anything but also wants everything and i am going through emotional whiplash i do not know how this turned into a rant about him i just i am depressed and i am not doing good and he is my one form of support and i have lost it i just want my daughter home and in my arms i guess that this whole thing is just a rant i am just going to walk back inside with a fake smile on my face i guess so that he can think that i am magically better what is ironic is he told me to open up to people and that my fears of what they will do is just stigma and unfounded but he is doing the exact thing that i was scared of this entire time he essentially proved me right i am all alone and no one will ever be able to help me thanks for reading if you have any tips for getting out of this depressive rut until i can get a new psychologist and new meds you would be my knights in shining armor right now i am on zoloft and buspar at the highest doses but they make me feel drunk and i cannot take those while caring for a daughter even though they do work outside of that if you have any medication recommendations as well i would love to hear them thanks again
1,my life is a mess and i do not think it would be worth the time to clean it up i am new to this subreddit and thought that this would be a good place get a couple of things off of my shoulders and just share my story so far i apologize for the lengthy post my depression started late in my sixth grade year it began with subtle thoughts of self harm and lengthy sessions of negative thinking by the end of the school year my family moved to the out skirts of a small town bordering the state of washington once we settled in my mother forced me to ride out the last few weeks of school my first day at the new school felt unwelcoming most people generally ignored me and the few that did not were very manipulative using the fact that i was new to bolster their reputation by the time that summer vacation rolled around my only friend invited me to stay at his house for the majority of the break most of the things that plagued my mind faded into obscurity only coming back during long nights nearing the end of my stay my friend decided to show me his grandfathers stash of firearms with the supervision of his grandfather later that night i had developed a plan to use one of the guns to end it all but never came to fruition due to leaving the next day the rest of the summer flew by leading into the next school year i was still relatively new to the school so i was still in the same circumstances i was last year a new element that was introduced was a lack of interest and work ethic which lead to my grades plummeting late november i was met with extreme fatigue that would last throughout the day resulting in me sleeping through the majority of my classes this would continue to the next school year i still had not made any friends only interacting with others when i had to during lunch breaks i usually sat alone sometimes being bothered by groups of the popular kids to get me to say something to satisfy their curiosity and boredom or a concerned teacher or staff member the end of the year my grades hung around failing and barely passing resulting in me going to summer school this summer was uneventful besides summer school my friend did not make any attempts to reach out to talk to me so i just laid around stewing in my thoughts in the isolation of my room 8th grade was like 7th grade only differing slightly my period of isolation during the summer had left stricken with disturbing thoughts paranoia and anxiety during group activities i struggled with speaking to others finding myself stammering when trying to speak at a normal rate and spoke quietly i became embarrassed and would intentionally push myself away from projects later in the year one of the annoying kids became excessively irritating and decided to wake me as i slept during science class i broke my silence and started to berate him this left a lasting impression with some of my classmates after that day i started to focus on my anger as time went on our fights became long winded and increasingly aggressive not long after i got physical with him after he had confronted me outside of class he said something that i took offense to so i grabbed him by the shoulders and slammed him against the lockers after that event he gradually stopped speaking around me and skipped the last day once he had heard that i was going to fight him the summer was the same as last year summer school was as helpful as ever and my only friend not making any attempts to speak with me i again left to my thoughts of constant anger and depression my freshman year began slightly different i had developed a friendship with a girl that rode the bus with me she was also dealing with depression due to her abusive and controlling mother my depression dramatically increased in late november when i developed a crush on a girl from my neighborhood i became self destructive insulting my appearance and intelligence i came home in a bad mood all the time either in a blinding rage or in tears i convinced myself that i was not good enough for her and that nobody cared about me that i was worthless a week before christmas break i had come up with a new plan to kill myself the last week before christmas break was unbearable the thought of suicide weighed heavily on my mind thoughts constantly screaming at me throughout the day the last day before break during first period i broke down in tears i went to my councilor and confessed that i was going to kill myself after christmas day i was then taken to the hospital and was diagnosed with depression i the spent about a week and a half in the hospital and was released early due to good behavior some acting good attendance to activities and the fact that christmas was coming i left being prescribed zoloft and felt relatively normal for once in a long while christmas break came to an end not long after and school felt very much different in mid to late january i began getting migraines from taking zoloft and was shortly changed to fluoxetine not long after i then started to prepare for valentines day a couple of days before valentines day my friend and i went to get some flowers for my crush i had made plans with my crush to meet up but she missed it and rearranged for the 17th we met up that night and i confessed my feelings to her to the best of my ability she told me that she did not feel the same way and friend zoned me we have not spoken since i broke down in tears later that night spiraling back down into my depression i would find out sometime later that she never had any feelings for me and was already in a relationship before my confession covid would soon come around to cut the school year short and brought a new wave of anxiety and fear on top of my failed attempt at a relationship around mid may i stopped taking my medication thinking that i did not need it any longer june through august made a great amount of progress on myself i began the next school year happier than the last and put effort into my work this would last until november i quickly fell back into my old habits constantly degrading myself in late november i found out how my sisters truly felt about me they felt nothing but hate for me doing nothing but insult my appearance and intelligence and the fact that had no friends to their knowledge in december my fights with my sister got worse and now my mother started to side with my sisters and said that i have changed for the worst that i was not her son wishing for the old me to come back she than grounded me and took all of my possessions she would threaten me with the hospital and would threaten to call the cops if i did not comply this would continue throughout january and end in early february after that happened i began looking for friends so i had someone to relate to by march i had found a couple of people that gave me purpose to live again they helped me find a job and gave me someone to talk to when a felt like nothing in april i started working and hanging out with my friends more often by may it all fell apart i had gotten angry at work from being overwhelmed and two of my friends were working with me that day they thought that i was satan himself and started to spread rumors about me as a result i lost all of my friends and almost lost my job since then i have kept my job but have started to inflict pain upon myself from cuts to burns i have apologized to everyone since but i still hate myself for everything i have felt worse ever since then and have been struggling with my battle against depression once again i hope that i can get some advice or at least get some comfort so i can try to get back on track
1,gamers made me depressed i know that is a bold statement i made a similar post on reddit a while back but it got deleted after my google account was suspended because of that and the fact that a lot has transpired since then i figured i would repost the story here as typical of pretty much everyone born since the 80s i was into games ever since i was little got my wii when i was 6 played turok with my halfbrother on his old gaming device and poured hours into minecraft so as soon as i saw the trailer for fallout 4 back in 2015 i was almost immediately hooked i have always been a history buff along with being fascinated by dystopias and american nostalgia so fallout seemed right up my alley i was even more hyped when i saw a video from a youtuber i liked at the time that talked about the fallout universe and the lore behind it sadly i was only 11 at the time so it was not likely my parents would let me buy it but i was patient and by 2017 i was finally able to play let me say i absolutely loved it i thought the story was heartwrenching and i fell in love with all the characters in the game over the next year i went on to play both 3 and new vegas and loved them just as much although as time went on i started to realize people had different opinions as me which is fine i want to make it clear right now that i do not have a problem with people disliking things i like in fact there are plenty of other opinions in which i hold that are wildly unpopular online hell at first i was not even mad they disagreed with me i just saw us as having a differing opinion and left it at that but as i spent more time online it became more and more annoying to see some of these fans talk they seemed to act as if what they loved was objectively superior and then rub it in my face this post is a good example and this one there are a lot more i could show you but i think you get the picture moving along i was able to tune it all out even after fallout 76 came out a game that was reviewed so poorly it seemed to vindicate these fanboys i personally did not like 76 anyway and figured that most of the hate was independent of the hate for 3 and 4 so i continued to enjoy games as much up until the summer of 2019 but there was one last thing that truly kicked off my depression there is a fallout youtuber called oxhorn he seemed like a decent youtuber and i was even comforted by the fact that he seemed to be a big name in the community and liked fallout 4 well i soon found that after fallout 76 came out people were out there trying to cancal him some of the things people were saying about him let me down but i saw it as an opportunity to see these people for who they really were people who were willing to smear someone for what they did or did not like people also seemed to side with oxhorn when it came to his response which got a few hundred thousand views so i was at peace well as if the universe wanted to fuck me over the wellrespected youtuber the right opinion made his own video on the matter one that got over a million views and effectively ruined my life it seemed that the new vagas fanboys won in the end their ability to smear people if they liked something they did not calling them names while jacking off for the game that was special to them without consideration for what was special to me since then things have gotten much worse everywhere i look online people praise new vegas and constantly use it to oneup 4 it is even extended to real life i talked with a guy recently who claimed i had a bad taste in character and in games for expressing my opinions on new vegas someone else chimed in and said you do realize new vegas is the most critically acclaimed fallout game right a message that is been repeated to me again and again yes i get it everyone fucking loves new vegas i loved it too everyone also hates fallout 4 and apparently i have shit taste in storytelling because i loved it as well i get it maybe you are right maybe i am just one big idiot whose opinions are invalid and no one agrees with them that is fine but why do you got to rub it in my face now i cannot enjoy games anymore all the fun just seemed to be sucked out of them the sad part is i only really got to play four mature games on my own the three fallout games i already mentioned and a fourth one called we happy few but after all this drama it was taken away from me the real irony is that when i finally got the chance to play a game the outer worlds that was made by the original creators of fallout which these new vegas fanboys were worshiping as a genius i was already too depressed to play it it is not even just fallout i cannot play a single game with the excitement and enthusiasm i once did i guess that is because of the gaming community in general the instant fanboyism and hatred for companies that i could not give a shit about i know you will probably argue i should not let it get to me believe me for the longest time it did not but it just became too much now i have lost an important part of my life it is because of this i have been severely depressed for the past couple of years keep in mind this is not the only reason i am feeling this way i do not have many friends i feel as if i fail at everything i do and i am just feeling like life has no meaning so ya know typical depression bull shit it is just that gaming was a big coping mechanism for much of my life so to have it stripped away from me as this has really caused me to become apathetic about pretty much everything it makes me feel like i cannot go on any longer i actually went berserk recently and made many reddit posts telling people they fucked up my life i know that was insane but i did not know what to do i felt so alone i felt like i knew one was listening i went on to post a video onto youtube saying i was going to you know end it all my dumb ass even had the balls to email ign and demand them to spread my story i know it is crazy believe me i was desperate i just wanted people to understand how i felt i know no one does that is fine all i know is i am just depressed you do not have to understand if ya cannot i just want people to listen i know all this sounds dumb i want to reiterate that this is not only just because of games and even if it was they were pretty important to me a lot of you guys grew up on games you must know what it is like to be my age it was something that kept me through the day and now it is gone i feel like my adolescence has been robbed from me i was only 15 when i stopped enjoying games now i am 17 and i do not imagine i will have time for them in the future i would like to conclude on one note if any of you ever held any opinions that were different from mine that is fine i have always respected them and i will continue to respect them but if you acted cruelly or did everything you could to make me feel this way then congratulations it is because of you that my life feels empty it is because of you i have lost one of my favorite hobbies i hope you are happy
1,the worst thing about my stress is that no one sees the worst stressors hello i hope i follow the rules as this is my first post here i just need to let out how worried i am right now i will put a tldr at the end because this will be a doosie the following paragraph is just backstorywho i am i am 23 straight male just finished college bachelors in general studies also i am a talented musician and have had somewhat of a small business going for a couple years now utilizing a variety of instrumental and technical audio engineering skills i live on my own single in a nice little apartment and drive a 2010 malibu music is a legit income and i also drive as a doordash driver i am fresh out of school and applying for entry jobs in finance and social work in the meantime i got an easy job part time at a restaurant my best friend works at my circle of friends is typical and i have an amazing immediate family 2 bros 1 sis all same parents my credit score is considered good on the scale thingy seems like i am doing not too shabby right hahahahahah no let me get into my stressors now let us start with ones that folks know of i have ptsd that tends to sideline me out of nowhere it sucks but i have been pushing thru since the event happened at 17 everyone who loves me knows the details and supports me well they also understand that the entrepreneurial lifestyle i have chosen puts a lot of stress on me they know how hard i work and the sacrifice it takes i am the black sheep brotherfriend who is always too busy along with every human the coco sniffles have also been a dark cloud over my life the past year or so so i have mental illness and a busy schedule weighing on me join the club right life is hard and i would say the things above add up to pretty normal stress factors as a human but these are the tip of the ice burg let us break down the real demons below trigger warning for addicts let us start with the college thing since ptsd had me bedridden right after high school graduation my mom pretty much held my hand and pushed me into an easy college program i am not bitter with her but that in itself could be a whole post i just question the decision these days because my love for music is pretty much all my existance contains most people assume i had a full ride to the degree since both of my older siblings have grad degrees and are doctors everyone supported my college journey like a plan b as i kept hustlin music on the side well that degree put me 20k in debt and i do not know if i will even use it time will tell but it is just eating me alive realizing that for the next two decades i may literally spend 5 microphone booths worth of cash on a degree that just sits there so yea big debt lingering from school and lots of people do not know the details next up cars it looks like i own it but i am making monthly payments on my current car those payments are set to go to my sister who owned it before me for 9 months hopefully i pay off early that one is nothing compared to the first car i ever bought which i kind of regret buying i owe 9k on a 2016 ford focus that is now on a lot because i totaled it in december remember december key detail i had full coverage but the deductable was huge like 2k i literally do not know how tf i am ever going to pay back the lender if it amounts to thousands and they will not take payments being selfemployed all of 2020 has me up a creek regarding acquiring loans i have been denied so many times i am on hold with it knowing too many inquiries can ding credit score the worst thing is that it is march it is march and i am still waiting on a financial result from a car accident that happened in december speaking of credit i have been excellent at keeping balances low on the 2 small credit cards i have until about a week ago this will make sense shortly now for the real grit i have been battling porn addiction since around 14 so pretty much 10 years of just trying to get through each day without jerking it to fake people pretending to have sex i will not go into detail with the porn thing just know that it is pretty much my darkest vice and with every fleeting moment i ask myself will i ever break the habbit i mean i am not a 3 hours every night addict but i cannot stop i cannot stop fleeing to it on occasion i feel like a monster and an outofcontrol sex addict you may wonder at this point and to answer your question no i was never sexually abused ptsd is from something way different and i have had a pretty normal sex lifedating history but man i cannot say no to the porn screen sometimes at my lowest point which was last week or so i paid a bunch of money trying to buy sex from snapchat hookers they all either fell through or scammed me probably a blessing if this vice keeps winning will it get worse where is this drug taking me i do not like thinking about those questions because this unseen drug is one of the most lifethreatening ones see rnofap it is my secret vice no one sees it but it is a constant war the hookers are where those credit cards went by the way lastly substance abuse i am pretty moderate with drinking alcohol and smoking weed but recently i have found myself wanting to drink and smoke as selfmedication until recently it was just a drink here or there with friends for the first time in my life i am seeing these activities creep in as an escape from reality this is a new realization and i have not spoken to anyone i could be overthinking this one but man i have seen too many victims go off the deep end before even realizing what the heck was going on to my friends i know i probably seem perfectly normal but they have not seen the couple of times i completely blacked out all alone while they are at work and assume i am drivingin studio that is not always the case every once in a while i just mope around smoking loads of weed and watching youknowwhat in conclusion i feel like on the surface i look like a confident young man with a lot going for him and not a lot of red flags but in my soul i can feel these lethal vices coming to get me i have not been this stressed since my ptsd incident at 17 i know this has been a long post so if you are still here i genuinely appreciate you any comments are appreciated as well bless stay safe everyone tldr i am a pretty normal guy i think but finance porn and alcohol and weed are starting to stress me out and i am afraid i am spiraling into a notgood place
1,is todays world too stressful it is too stressful for some people and just fine for others i find it too stressful some days and other days i feel like i am coping whether or not you feel stressed comes down to yourperspective if you think that something is stressful guess what you are going to feel stressed why do we get stressed some people feel stressed because of timesometimes it is hard to believe you can fit everything into one day you go to a job for 8 to 10 hours and then you come home and have to do chores and make dinner for you and maybe even an entire family after dinner you probably have more chores and a checklist of todos that have been eating away at your mind for weeks you go to bed and then wake up to do it all over again some people feel stressed because of their environmentshumans have built cities concrete concrete concrete busy busy busy we naturally feel more relaxed when we see green and natural landscapes but now there is people everywhere and not a flower in sight it seems like we never have a minute of calm anymore not to mention all the places you have to go in one day maybe work is a stressful place maybe your house is more chaotic than you want it to be even your commute to work can feel stressful sometimes some people feel stressed from meaninglessnessit is hard to do the same thing over and over again and feel like you have no end goal you constantly have chores to do a job to perform and likely a family or people to take care of everyday but where the heck does it get you at the end of the day what are you working towards all of these points make the world sound like a pretty crappy place but let us think about the things wedo nothave to stress about you probably do not have to worry about hunting for food finding shelter in winter or worry about a bear attacking you and your family it is funny how society meets all of our needs yet we still find so many things to be stressed about how can we become unstressed unfortunately it is hard to eliminate stress completely in one day we arehabitual creatures you probably get stressed about similar things throughout the week you have developed stress habits over the course of your life in order to break these habits you have to performselfchecksand developselfawarenessso you can stop yourself before you go down a stress path you have to becomeconscious of you stressbefore you can stop it figure out what is making you stressed honestly a lot of people do not know what makes them stressed i have times in the day when i feel anxious but i have no idea why so i started writing things down when i got stressed i recorded how i felt what was happening in my environment and what time of day it was i also tried journaling a bit at night and performingselfchecksthroughout the busy day i learned that you have to start talking to yourself you have to ask yourselfhow you are doingfrom this experience i found patterns in my stress behaviour i usestress freeto keep track of my daily trends simply put only you because your own stress no matter what you blame your stress on your environment your boss your spouse your kids at the end of the dayyour stress is your faultokay external factors like poverty or an unhealthy marriage obviously do not facilitate being stressed but it comes down to realizing that you are the problem until you stop blaming external factors for your stress you cannot fix it for example if you blame your job for your stress your brain is convinced that the stress will only go away if the job goes away you are practicingselfhelplessness before you can make changes come to the realization that you are the one making yourself stressed i know it is mean but that is life feel grateful for what you havesometimes i forget to be grateful for what i have my family is in good health i have a wonderful boyfriend and i have a secure job right out of university no matter how great of a situation we are born into or we have made for ourselves we still find ways to be stressed we make things up in our head when i get that promotion i will be happy when i finally get married i will be happy you cannot just keep looking into the future for your happinessyou have to practice happiness in the now try meditation and breathing exercisesokay you are probably rolling your eyes meditation and mindfulness seem to becoming buzz words now but in all honesty meditation is how i developed my selfawarness i am constantly training myself to check in with my emotions and stop myself from going down my stress paths it is hard to meditate at first it is hard to sit in silence and ask yourself tough questions i mean when do we ever experience complete silence anymore we are either on our phone listening to music watching netflix or keeping ourselves busy so practiceliterally doing nothing eat healthier get more sleep you have probably read a lot of blog articles about getting your beauty sleep or eating super foods i approach these rules in my own way i try to eat a bit of everything but mostly things that come from the ground i wanted to see what happened if i removed sugar from my diet within a couple of weeks yes the first few days were hard i noticed i felt less anxious and i no longer craved buying sweets on my weekly trip to the grocery store when i added a small salad to my daily diet i noticed my hair was growing faster and my nails got stronger so you do not have to eat only kale just try branching out and eating some veggies you would not normally eat take it one day at a time and turn it into a habit habits are your worst enemy but they can also be your best friend when you take the time to develop good habits it can take several weeks to replace a bad habit with a good one i like to focus onimproving myself by 001 a day and not everyday will be better i am a person and sometimes i just have sad days but start to check in with yourself figure out what is making you stressed and try to love yourself more the world is only stressful if you see it that way do the hard thing and convince yourself otherwise please comment please connect i love talking to people oneonone for more please see my blog katieclearcom
1,i am dying all alone hello reddit i am a 54 m who has recently been diagnosed with a terminal disease according to doctors i have a limited time untill cancer spreads everywhere in my body that however is not what i want to talk about i have had a hard life i spent most of my childhood all alone with no friends always desperate for tiniest bit of affection my parents were both too busy with their jobs to show affection to me while i am deeply grateful for all the things they did for me and various ways they shown how much they care about me back in that time i did not understand any of that all i could see was how other parents hug and play with their kids but my parents did not i did a huge deal of stupid stuff in my childhood to get their attention so many stupid and embarrassing things that i do not remember anymore since i really do not want to overall i hated my childhood i have never had any problems with my gender and behaved manly because i was comfortable with it however since a long time before i stepped into my teen years i knew i was maybe a little bit different i hated sports instead i really loved reading books there were some other examples but like i said i do not remember much about my childhood i also did not think they were a big deal when i became a teenager i discovered that unlike any other teenage boys i knew i was weirdly not interested in girls for some reason i thought that i will probably get there in time i did not now i was different in a very conservative and judging society a society which even divorced people get looked at with anger when i realized that instead of getting attracted to girls i like boys i panicked i was only 14 i knew very little i thought i will get out of this mess as i grow older in that period of time i thought i was the only one like that i was different for the rest of my teenage life i ignored that hoping for a change in my preference in the future when i grew older i became aware of what situation i was in i was gay even to this day i cannot say that word without my voice shaking i tried everything to change it did not work many many questions were raised in my head like why am i like this how am i going to live like this i encountered a huge moral religious and cultural dilemma it was horrible untill this day i have got no answers it was simply so much for me to process this quickly affected me and became a major source of depression anxiety social insecurities and etc i gained a lot of weight as a result and went through a very depressing path due to all the stress and anxiety i encountered achromotrichia and my hairs started becoming white at early ages then i went through a severe phase when i was 18 in which i tried confronting myself i tried my best to accept who i am i did not want to change just wanted to come clean and admit it it was not successful i fell down a hole of worse distancing and anxiety from 2 of my friends whom i came out to one refused to believe what i am and one cut ties with me my best friend even though he could not believe it was actually supportive but soon he moved far away in a different state i had no one to talk to my family did not know what was wrong with me and everything they did to help me only made it worse i could not stand how sad my parents would get if i told them what i was after all they did for me i could not bring tears to my moms eyes and sadness to my dad i spent about a month just waking up eating and staring at my room with no purpose i finally had it decided after 32 days i started planning my suicide everything was set on that day i already did everything and i went to bed early that night so that i would be ready for the big day as i was tying the rope around my neck i heard my little sisters laughter i burst into tears once again i was being selfish how could i make her little heart sad how cruel can someone be to hurt a little girl like that i stopped i knew this would happen again if i do not make any changes so i did i promised my self never to think of that issue again i suppressed my sexual desires i kept myself busy with other stuff so that i would not get distracted i was once again able to wake up without immediately remembering what i was i could live my pathetic life again when i was aware of my condition i made myself a promise that i would not emotionally hurt anyone and that i do not do anything about my sex life fun fact i am still a virgin til this day despite my familys pressure i did not get married how could i force myself to like a women and ruin her life why would i start a family which i cannot love the way i should why would i ruin someone elses life because of my selfishness i did not date or confess to anyone either as far as i knew i could not live with the emotional weight of accepting who i am how could i enter a relationship and transfer all my insecurities to another person the night that i made myself that promise i very well knew this means i will die all alone with no one to hold me hug me or kiss me funny how i still crave human contact though i did not have any even when i was a kid rest of my life was boring i lived i had a good job with good payment that is it i never felt happy i had some fallbacks but mostly tried eliminating my feelings i never told anyone what i was again i lived as the creepy alone man who lives next door and now i have cancer with a much more limited time than ever i am actually kind of happy it will all end soon i only wish i could be happier without all these regrets i would have wished a world in which gay people were not looked at differently but i cannot imagine how would that go i would also wish for me to be straight but i honestly have no idea how that works not once i was interested in women to have a sense of that i even tried looking at pictures of hot women it is hilarious i know for a long time in my young years to see if anything happens but it did not so at the end i am soon dying never kissed the person i loved or even met the person i loved full of depression and sadness and 54 years of loneliness i do not exactly know who will read this i never got noticed in my life i do not see why i should be noticed now i also do not know how much time i have left so i say to the world farewell i did not hate you but i hated myself the most
1,my upbringing i do not know yet if this text is selftherapeutic or i am looking for opinions probably both like always my upbringing was fine my parents do not fit together too well and their relationship is nowhere the definition of healthy but there was no physical violence we went to vacation and we had enough money to buy everything a family needs with that being said i never developed a deep emotional relationship to my parents i never talked about emotional issues with them or emotions and feelings in general myself evolved into a egotistical and narcissistic personality as soon as i hit the age 68 i have no clue whyi definitely developed a fragile ego until i was 10 but things just started there i was still one a high horse in my class i was the first boy with a gf 14yo i was in love with her but 45 months into the relationship i got kind of bored and ended it i restarted it a few times because i was impressionable the bigger and older guys in my basketball group said i did a mistake but a few months later i was still abusing her love for me just to make out you see a very fragile but selfcentered ego the next 2 years i continued having relationships with girls i also changed school because i was lazy as fuck in retrospect this was the worst decisions of my life with 1617 i started going to parties i got wasted a lot i met my todays best friend i also met this boy he was from my old school same year but different class therefore i did not know him yet we we are chatting a lot we hit it off immediately and very soon i realized i like boys he gave me weird signals we cuddled and so on but eventually he made it clear he is not gay the last 2 sentences outline like 67 months maybe more when we we are at friends we cuddled we played footsie it never happened much more at least nothing i have to add here as i said eventually i told him he said nope unfortunately we still met and even more unfortunately we still cuddled i could not finish this story and this is when things heated up i got wasted more and more i got drugged up i cannot specifically remember the precise timeline after intense alcohol sessions and weed mdma arrived as well i did way too much mdma amphetamines methamphetamines cocaine medicaments acid ketamine everything i was not addicted to one specific substance back then i was just permanently drugged up of course wrong friends joined my life the good old circle appeared which our parents have been warning us since we have been kids suppressing my emotions was the target and i cannot say i did not achieve that the rock bottom was new years eve my best friend said we are done until i am not completely insane anymore since the boy i fell in love became very good friends with my best friend and we were going to parties altogether i got extremely jealous i tried to separate them i got aggressive this led to the message of my best friend on new years eve luckily i had a few brain cells left and this was a turn point in my life i tried to get my shit together over the next 5 years i did less and less drugs i was not as pretty as before because i fucked up my body so i also looked for a healthy life style i was very insecure of my look for years i did not date anyone even though i believed i had overcome him i did not care anymore when he was around i passively began to dislike him the last 3 years i was catching up my a level since i left the school with 14 and i only did 10 years of school instead of 12germany in this time span my main issue was weed i smoked for 3 months then i was literally sober for 25 months not even drinking coffee or a beer i repeated that several times i barely saw this boy the past years 2 months ago i finished my a level i also was sober for 10 months and besides school i was working 160 hours as a nurse in an elderly hometo this day after the exam i obviously started smoking weed again but this time not the whole day without going to work only after work only one joint well it bored me that much that i flushed down 50 bucks of weed i guess weed is history but a few weeks ago i saw him and what can i say but the first cut is the deepest it is been 7 years and i still love him never believed he is not interested in boys i think the past years when i tried becoming a better me i actually got a few emotions back the past two months i became more pretty again i healed i felt the higher testosterone floating through my body my interest in relationships increased though i did not look for it now when i met him i guess i just realized i never closed this chapter the next few days i was high af on him and weed i still smoked back then then the low point eventually appeared and i do not know i feel like shit now depressed i do not care if i die tomorrow i do not care if i go to jail the past years i had actual symptoms of antisocial personality disorder no i am not that edgy kid who thinks sociopaths are cool id kill someone to start again in 2016 to avoid evolving into something like today i had intense anger breakouts i physically hurt my mommy i destroyed a door in my anger i became such a good liar and manipulator i know which buttons to press in people i committed a few crimes no severe ones ok one time i was one 700mcg acid and i had to call the ambulance because i low kicked the leg of a paramedic they had to call the police i also got violent towards the police and eventually ended up in the icu my arms and legs were fixed to the bed for safety reasons i also lacked empathy i had much darker thoughts too but i will not type them here i am honestly concerned i am so depressed atm but i am also extremely motivated at the same time i want to finally date someone sports every day i read nearly 2 non fictions book per week i want to go to university but i am also depressed and if id die tonight id be actually okay with it i want him i do not understand why it never happened when i met him a few weeks ago i thought he flirted with me but i lack empathy and i am insane i would not even say i am 30 sure sorry for my english i am german and i did not try too hard i tried to make it as short as possible many details are missing no clue why i post this here
1,can someone read this it is my full story if i can have at least one person read this it would make me feel really happy because someone can get the full picture of my life i am a black 17m in highschool who lives in the usa my interests fall in computer science math video games and animemanga when i was younger i loved video games so much and i still do to this day video games were the reason i was planning to work at a game development studio in the future i felt more understood by vgs than i did with my family i am not close with my family and i do not ever will be because they are toxic af i have been psychologically abused and nobody would ever listen to my end of the story they are the major because for my depression and some for my suicidal tendencies as more time passed i would stay in my room as much as i can because i whenever i would step out my parents would drag with them to some store usually insult me or whine about how lazy i am my mom has been more abusive but at the same time she is an idiot who i was able fool on a few occasions my dad is annoying and racist for some ungodly reason he hates white people which makes me embarrassed to have him as a father my stepmom is stupid and racist so i cannot stand her certainly least my sister is a literal bitch who has no regard for anyones feelings school is the worst thing to have ever happened to me i do not even know where to begin with school because i have had so much shitty stuff happen to me elementary school was ok i was easy target for harassment but it is not as bad as it was in middle school when i was in elementary school i never saw the importance of school i barely did any work and never bothered to pay attention in class almost everyday in elementary school i just looked forward to going home and playing on my nintendo ds it was my major motivation back then then came middle school this is where so many problems came to rise words cannot describe how horrible my middle school experience was this is when school pressure really started hitting me and that i felt the need to work harder i had only like one friend in the beginning of 6 grade and by then i began getting bullied by having that friend this friend of mine was seen as very strange and weird by every other student but i defended him and decided to go through constant harassment so i can keep being his friend one day at the end of the year my science teacher decided to expose me in front of the class because she got so sick of me not turning my work i do not blame her though lol next is 7th grade where there was no end to bullying throughout the school year i tried so hard to fit in and be like everyone else but it really backfired making me look more like an idiot i would do the most retarted shit just for attention because i felt so lonely worst idea ever now those memories are stuck with the other students who went to class with me i asked i crush out and she rejected me was not much a big deal but i did feel pretty embarrassed after almost all my friends were fake and would easily turn their back on me whenever i was alone thoughts of self harm would become more frequent and whenever i was not i was being harassed by someone the last day of 7th grade is literally the worst day of my life completely lonely the first half then midday i accidentally fell in some chalk that was on the concrete and it ruined the clothes i was wearing that day my friend saw this as the perfect opportunity to embarrass me in front of much other students as he can almost immediately when he found out he literally started running around the school and tried to tell almost anyone nearby about how dumb i looked with chalk on my clothes students nearly when they saw me just gave a weird look or an expression of confusion i was so suicidal that day next is 8th grade not as terrible as 7th but still bad i was admitted into a 9th grade biology class because of my great grades in 7th grade environmental science but the biology class was horrible to be in the teacher was absolute shit and made it harder for us just for the sake of it when i came in that class on the first day i almost had a heart attack because there were so many students who were admitted in this class and i knew none of them some of the other students i sat with hated me because i got some of the concepts confusing insert some more embarrassing moments then you have 8th grade high school is better then middle school but i still hate school in general 9th grade i have never been so lonely 10th grade my existential crisis began 11th grade suicide attempts 12 burnout and more suicide attempts i do not want to treat life as a separate entity but 2020 killed me this year i wish i can just take a mental break but my parents are denying my depressive symptoms doing schoolwork has never been so difficult holy shit if i cannot even do it well in high school then how can i do it college life is so horrible i get abused for the most minor things and i do not know what to do anymore i have no idea what to do for the future because i ruined my grades and i have overthought what i want to be when i grow up i attempted suicide like over 10 times this year but none of them work i do not understand why people just will not help me even when i reach out i wish my life just ended by whatever means i do not to be homeless especially at this because it is insanely cold outside my point is everything is just not fucking fair i actively try do the most i can to rid depression and do my schoolwork but nobody will fucking cooperate with me even when i am having my best day i still always contemplate on suicide as if it is the answer to my life i low key wish someone would hug me thank you for reading i am grateful to whoever took the time out to read this sorry it was long edit i really want to thank all of you for the kind words really i do i wish i can meet all of you and you guys hugs because i was feeling lonely and felt the need to share i full story but i did not expect this much feedback i am really grateful for all for this community and all you who react out red_heart
1,i attempted suicide by crashing my car into a highway median at 200 kmh and walked out with a minor concussion i feel like it is a sign i need to step up my action against depression what are some things i can do to alleviate my depression the title and this story may sound fake new account to hopefully protect my identity but i swear to you it could not be more real for me i wanted to share this i am not doing this for attention but merely to seek help more questions will be asked at the end of my story as the title describes a miracle has occurred given the severity and intent of the crash the paramedics police doctors nurses and my parents all gave me the most puzzled look of their lives when they asked how fast i was going and i replied 200 kmh i have been depressed for 4 years now nothing has been working and my mental health has declined terribly i have been on multiple medications tried behavioural therapy such as cognitive behaviour therapy cbt and even went a course of electroconvulsive therapy ect first my motivation to do anything went down i could not eat do school work and most importantly socialize my social circle grew smaller as my depression grew bigger after 4 years of suffering as well as other health conditions such as horrible eyesight 1000 in each eye with astigmatism sleep apnea and anxiety i figured life was not going to get any better and i decided to end my life i drove to the mountains where i decided i would find a large hill go full speed down it and either turn into the median or drive off the road ultimately killing myself about 3 hours from my hometown i found the perfect hill the road was steep perfect for gaining speed to ensure a fatal crash without thinking too much i would just talk myself out and not commit i pulled a youturn and drove to the hill which was about 5 minutes after that point they say your life flashes before your eyes mine played back to me for those 5 minutes the most important people and influential moments of my life appeared before my eyes they suddenly disappeared as i approached my chosen hill my foot automatically floored the gas pedal i placed my left foot behind the brake so i would not back out i raced down the hill gaining more and more speed by the time i reached the bottom my car which only has a speedometer for up to 200 kmh i saw the road start to bend and i jerked my wheel into the opposite direction of the turn slamming the front end of the car into the median that was the last thing i remembered before waking up in my car with tapping on the window from bystanders all i could think to myself at that moment was wow i so much of a failure i cannot even kill myself a bystander described to the paramedics and police that i hit the median did about 10 spins no flips and then continued to scrape median down the hill for another 250m i got a glimpse of my car before i was taken away in an ambulance it was completely destroyed when i arrived to the hospital i was placed in the trauma room however the doctor was incredibly surprised after seeing me sitting upright with consciousness after a 200 kmh car accident he assessed me and ordered a fullbody ct scan the results came back clean no bleeding no broken bones and most importantly no death he then admitted me to the psychiatry ward which i will not get into on this post but it was a nightmare the everyone is surprise i was barely injured walking away with a concussion with memory loss at most this phrase really stuck in my mind because nearly every person i have talked to so far has said it is a miracle you are alive i am not religious but i agree it is a miracle i am alive and im not going to waste it i am begging for help because i know this community loves to help people when they reach out i really want to try and beat my depression but i do not know how i have tried cbt i am going back to ect for another round of treatment and i am on increased medication i will be seeing counsellors and psychiatrists however thanks to canadian healthcare not until 2020 which is one of the reasons i decided to end it due to lack of resources if anyone out there has any tips on how to manage severe depression and anxiety please let me know i am still alive today despite the severity of the crash and i believe it is a sign that i need to conquer this depression and do something great with my life i am tired of laying at home with no energy and no motivation wasting away my life every day with my depression i can personally say even those who are suiciding do not want to die they merely just want to stop existing please help with any advice you have i am begging for my life to change please i am trying my best to push past my depression and suicidal thinking so i can give life another try here are a list of specific questions that would benefit a lot how do i keep up my motivation despite having no energy all the time how can i keep up or have more energy

more stressful what are some habits i could do to alleviate my depression any secret selfhelpfeel good tips how do i make more friends and build a better support network what do i tell to my friends

1,what should i do about chronic stress hi i am 20 years old and kind of accepting that i have got chronic stress issues i am not sure how to deal with it exactly and it is been 3 months i remember seeing a doctor a while ago and talked about what caused my stressbreakdown last semester and he said it was acute stress i did not really know what that meant at the time but overall i felt like it was an unhelpful experience because all of his advice exercise things like that and wisdom did not really help me or i knew would not work because i had already tried i even tried antidepressants because i thought it could have been something i needed but that did not help i would say for the past 2 years of my life i have done a great job at handling acute stress that was the only type of stress i knew chronic stress however is something that i do not understand it is new to me and requires a greater amount of life changes and mental perspective it feels inhuman almost to have chronic stress it is admittedly frustrating because i feel too young for it i am at an age where i should continue to develop myself with my hobbies and stuff but instead every day is typically a rollercoaster my ability to concentratefocus has been incredibly diminished and i find the idea of getting back in to school stressful i am an engineering major but if math stresses me out i am just not sure if i can keep it in my life on the flip side i want to be doing those things because i liked the challenge the stress is like a token that just keeps flipping and makes things confusing i doubly worry because i start to think i have mental health issues and the fact is that stress can open up mental health issues i find that when the stress gets to a breaking point which has only happened once in my life i shut down and withdraw and make what changes feel necessary instead of opening up in to some sort of mania or whatever but fuck man how am i supposed to know what to expect if it keeps going there are things which because me stress that i do not think are supposed to cause me that much stress but they simply do because it is chronic i guess i do not know if im supposed to push on and work on my problems in the storm or withdraw and bide my time i also seem to suffer from anhedonia an inability to feel pleasure if i isolate myself from anything stressful school work etc it is possible to feel some pleasure albeit a small amount i have been trying to tackle the problem by getting back in to the things that used to give me pleasure weightlifting was a big one and then taking on the more stressful things school and work but the stressful things seem to outdo any pleasure effects what really kills me is that my sleep suffers if i could get 8 hours a night i would be able to push through without worrying but for the past 3 nights i have gotten probably 56 hours of sleep i have not even started school yet and i do not really work that much so now i am sitting here typing this post and worrying about stress again i truthfully do not know what to do or what in particular causes my chronic stress i want to live life like normally so i can combat depression and things like that but then the stress keeps me up i am seeing a counselor and hopefully a therapist soon but i am in the early stages of that is this something that can be medicated can you medicate stress away or does it boil down to lifestyle changes i have done a pretty damn good job of having a healthy lifestyle for the past couple years which is another frustrating thing i do not drink smoke but admittedly i think about sex too much and i would say that is my vice at the moment it was also a source of stress for me that contributed to this chronic stress in some way that said i do not pursue sex in an unhealthy way but i might be a little more flirty or resort to jackin it to try and fill some sort of void that i am missing i eat pretty healthily not a fan of soda or junk food i see food more as calories and less for pleasure other than that i loved weightlifting and for a good while was able to do both cardio and heavy lifting now however i feel like that contributes to my stress a little bit because i know i do not sleep enough to be able to lift weights and recover without it causing too much stress i want to bulk up a bit and get back to more intenseheavier lifting but i am not sure if that is even healthy for me in my given state at the same time i get stressed out after a week or two if i am not doing that lol again with the flipping a token thing i do not really like being around my friends or people as much when i am like this not because i am in a bad mood but because i know i cannot simply vibe with them i will be too worried about feeling stressed out to actually enjoy it this is why i think i really like counseling because it is just a place for you to go to talk about your problems with someone my only solace has been learning how to play my guitar but that is not what i intend to do with the rest of my life and it does not always take the stress away sometimes i just get tired of playing it what are my options i am 20 years old live at home with my dad so i do not have much responsibility thankfully i have done quite a bit with my life that i am happy about so i feel like i was doing what i wanted so it is tough thinking about how to change all the things i have been doing have helped me grow as a person and alleviate that sort of depression you get when you are just not doing anything with yourself but again now when i start doing those things i experience a lot of stress and have to come to a stop thus depression can come back i kind of yearn for when things did not feel this stressful the first two years of college feel like they could have been ages ago and man i thought that was a challenge because during that time i was just finding myself looking back on it though it was just easy to live in the present and deal with stress as it came not battling it every waking hour i understand things about mindfulness meditation making the right choices etc but man that does not explain why i cannot get enough sleep
1,stress vent low key plea for help and advice i have no job at the moment over the summer i started a landscaping company with my partner and things were starting off top notch when the summer ended i was starting school after dropping out after 2 years i dropped out because i had a huge falling out with an extremely close friend of mine i do not want to put too much details on what that falling out was but basically i destroyed his trust in me and not only that i lost literally every friend i had me and him where so close together that when shit hit the fan the other people in our circle stopped talking to me it took me 2 years to recoup my social loss and all the depression i had i had tried to commit suicide but failed after saying goodbye to my friends over the phone they called the police and they came out to speak with me during this time i also started to delete all my social media i deleted my twitter account instagram and partially my facebook i took down all my photos of my face and unfriended all my close friends except family because my only means of communication are thru facebook finally during that summer i started feeling like myself again as if things could turn for the better instead of the worse i chose to go back to school to try and put myself back on a good track in life when i was in school before the events above i was planning on joining the us army as a second lieutenant it is been a dream and passion of mine since i was born my parents have pictures of me all over the house in army costumes and huge cardboard boxes that i drew on to look like tanks i felt alive being in that uniform especially in college as i joined the universitys rotc program unfortunately as i grew older my parents health became poorer and poorer my father has crushed discs in his spine as well as diabetes and early onset dementia it is mostly he will forget directions to the store and what he did yesterday or 3 hours ago but apparently he will soon forget our names my mom has ms and fibromyalgia on top of ptsd from some trauma she experienced thru her childhood as well as had extensive surgeries in the past both take extremely potent pain killers my dad is the worst with it he literally snorts them like coke and does atleast 57 a day my mom has to control how much he takes but there pain is so severe most days there is no other remedy i can really show them i tried talking them into medical weed but my parents are not interested in the properties and say they will not work from there medical history you can tell they do not have any income except for my oldest brother who is a high functioning autistic adult currently on his masters program at the same school i was attending so financial issues has always been a problem for our family we do not have any other family with us both my moms side and my dads side hate us for some reason so it is really just me that they depend on i have another older brother but he moved out and has not spoken to any of us in awhile he calls during the holidays but that is really the only contact we have my parents are alwaysalways behind the ball on bills and we have had multiple disconnections from the electric company one time they did not pay for 3 months straight and the bill totaled 866 on top of reconnection fees so i had to figure out how to pay all of it because my parents had no earthly idea how to come up with the money every month for the past 3 years has been a challenge for money i have worked jobs stolen things sold drugs just to keep us up but it is just never enough 2 years ago they had a house they where buying and had went behind on the mortgage for almost 6 months i had no idea because they never told me about it they lost the house and had to move into a rental and who took care of that i did i have been having to care for my sick parents since i graduated high school i had to put my dreams aside because i could not just leave for the military they could not even last the couple of months i would be gone for training so i put my dreams away to try and hustle and work to bring them out i started looking into ways of making as much money as i possibly can but everytime i make a breakthrough something happens like my car breaking down or something does not get covered by insurance and since i stole it had come back to haunt me which of course i expected thankfully i never had to go to court or anything so i am having to pay a restitution which is too much a month for me to pay and yes i have been missing those payments i understand the repercussions of those actions but i have to focus my energy on maintaining my apartment which i rent ontop of my parents house which i help pay a portion for as well as the electric and internet as well as dog food for the dogs the gas for me and my dads car a portion of my oldest brothers books as well as other things here and there to keep them afloat and alive i am drowning in debt i went back to school to try and get a business degree this semester but the age old need for assistance from me came back to haunt me and instead of investing my financial aid from college on some business ideas i had to try and make it ended up going to there bills and mine when i realized i spent all my grant and scholarship money on bills and not my textbooks and school stuff i just withdrew no point in going to class unprepared also since it is the fall we have had no business for landscaping so we have been short on jobs i have been trying to apply for seasonal work and other jobs but so far it is been more of a bust than anything good now i am 1 week late on rent for my apartment i have to come up with close to 1000 in less than 3 days to pay my rent my bills and my parents rent and bills so i am basically beyond fucked i could kill myself but it is not going to solve the problem i just do not know what to do and to be honest i just wish i can be someone else right now like delete this saved game and start new lol that is my rant for the day i do not expect anyone to respond to this so if you read this and commented thanks for listening
1,not sure if i should call a doctor over my work stress hey all so i work in the social housing sector within the uk it is a really demanding area to work with a lot of vulnerable clients needing particular arrangements that are not always straight forward and particularly a large volume of requests and queries that feels never ending which i guess is the nature of this sector having a demanding customer base makes it difficult at the moment the team i work in is literally disintegrating in front of my very eyes our manager left a month ago this was after two weeks signed off for stress ultimately making the decision that he could not continue to do the job anymore following that our team leader then also went down with stress and is yet to return after being signed off again to make things worse two of our colleagues out of four are also leaving by the end of this month bringing us down to two staff left we on average are getting around about 5060 emails an hour to our team inbox and i am getting around 1030 in my personal inbox we also get jabbers instant messages and these are also relentless it is also worse because i live in a block managed by the social housing provider i work for and following lock down and me being a type 1 diabetic i have obviously been working from my flat which naturally then followed onto having to use my personal mobile to call customers and contractors meaning this is now ringing constantly ultimately i am starting to feel like i cannot relax at home it is becoming an office to me and i have no where else i can work as others have suggested working in a different room for example and again to make it worse our team is currently under review for lack of productivity we are trying our best but we are just literally drowning doing tasks that really do not sit with our team but because i am just an admin the head of my departments actual words no one will listen so i am now experiencing i think anxiety over the future of my job i know that i nearly had a meltdown on sunday following a week off simply over the thought of what was waiting for me in my inbox for monday morning i was throwing things crying i cannot really remember but know that my downstairs neighbour messaged me to ask if i was alright as she heard the commotion i covered up by saying i hypod naturally alongside the horrible situations i have going on in my job i am also the sole carer for my mum who is depressed and anxious and makes at least 2 or 3 attempts on her life a month she was in icu over christmas so i spent my christmas alone with her on breathing support in a ward at our local hospital so my symptoms at the moment feeling hot when i wake up before work sometimes hot and sweaty at points during the day getting really confused over emails where usually i would know to take a step back breath and look at it again i get overwhelmed now and lash outget angry at whatever it is struggling to eat before lunchdinner time i no longer feel hungry in the morning just bloated higher blood sugars than normal in the evening and morning but seem to be dropping around mid day but that may be down to not being able to eat not quite sure what the connections are between stress and diabetes i have been pacing a lot talking to myself on occasion as well which is starting to scare me a bit when i talk to myself it is always me having an argument with a colleague in my head but talking it out i am worried i am literally losing it massive lack of energy all i want to do is sleep but on the other hand i am actually falling asleep fine i just do not feel rested no matter how long i actually sleep for my rls restless leg syndrome has been going crazy constantly goes while i work and it is getting harder and harder to stop it only just noticed i am doing it right now getting general feelings of being hatedisolatednot wanted by colleagues and friends in the business and it is becoming an internal battle where i am fighting the idea of it being true but i am starting to feel i am losing that battle i have withdrawn from most if not all social events the business holds and prefer to lock myself in my flat unplug the internet and just sit quietly sometimes in the dark i have cried a few times as a result of nasty emails feeling harassed by colleagues even though they are not really harassing me they are doing their job of chasing me for updates but it feels so relentless and like i cannot get any help from anyone or can approach anyone to talk about how i am feeling i fear if i do they may just dismiss me anyways diarrhoea in the mornings on occasion can be really severe and foul but clears up by mid afternoon i am starting really early in the mornings around 56am where i can get up in time to get a head start and combined with not feeling refreshed after a nights sleep i am drinking lots of coffee far more than normal sorry to waffle on it is just i have recently used my doctors time for a couple of infections and some help quitting smoking and i am aware of how busy medical staff are during the pandemic so i do not really want to waste my doctors time is it worth me ringing them what would be the options i would get back do the above sound like symptoms of stress and are there any other diabetics here that have suffered with stress and if so how did it impact your management of it i guess i am more anxious about everyone thinking i am skiving but i am used to that i felt it the last time i had a hypoglycemic despite the fact everyone saw me black out and told me not to come in the next day so i could rest up still spent the hold day feeling uncomfortable just really do not know what to do i just want to cry and turn my computer off i really do not know if i can do it but i also know i can do it if that makes sense i moved roles last year in the same business and after just about a year in this area of the business i just question my ability whereas i never did before in my previous two roles sorry and thanks
1,life story alert i have never really considered myself suicidal but i have had thoughts before i have undiagnosed ocd and invasive thoughts so i have always assumed the suicidal thoughts were invasive in which they probably are because i have no compulsions or motivation to follow through i guess i mainly find comfort in the fact it is an option in a way it makes me feel like i am in control i am 28 with absolutely no friends i am married with 2 kids and they are the reason i am alive today i am still lonely as hell i always thought i was going to have the typical boys like in sitcoms poker night football watch parties always popping up unannounced etc all my friends are either dead in prison or addicted to drugs reason for the is because i have abandoned anyone that puts me or my family at risk kind of makes me feel guilty but my kids and wife come first i struggle to find my purpose i am obese and that paired with my mental health issues makes it hard for me to work a normal job i run a small demolition company to make ends meet it puts me in control of my situation and my schedule the downfall is it has made me more anti social then ever i have a problem meetingtrusting new people because to be honest most of my past friends and people that i have met have been total losers i did not have the greatest childhood it was not terrible either though my mom has always been a lost soul in a way blamed my dad for making her move to wisconsin from california was always going to the barbringing home random dudes so my sister pretty much raised me moved in with my dad when i was 12 he worked 12 hour days 6 days a week so never really spent time with him beyond weekend movie nights always kind of felt like a burden and treated like a chore instead of truly being pushed to become my best self worst part is i find myself treating my daughter like a burden because of my mental health makes me easily annoyed and very impatient i wish i had some damn patience anyway so after i moved in with my dad i started falling into the wrong crowd and eventually got sent back to my moms when i was 15 well long story in the middle of a long story short she called a social worker and sent me to a group home was i being a shit stain yea i was selling weed but who just abandons their child over that anyway after going through the group homes my dad took me back after 3 months back with my dad i met my wife at 17 everything was good for 3 years besides the fact my wifes parents dispised me and did everything in their power to tear us a part hindsight 2020 i cannot blame them because i was encouraging her to sneak outstay the night with me against their rules then at 20 i had my daughter its one of the best days of my life i love my daughter to death but ever since then i have had added pressure and this sense of being restricted that i never felt before added note i was homeless from 13 to 23 besides the short stints i lived with my mom dad or was in the group home from 2023 i just could not get my shit together job after job followed by irresponsible choice after irresponsible choice finally at 23 after couch hopping all those years me and my wife got our first placethat we kept more then 3 months life started turning around and then i had my first panic attack talk about getting torn a new asshole as i do with everything though i pushed through and weathered the storm fast forward 3 years and i welcomed my son into the world another best moment ever followed by added pressure and more restriction this was shortly after i started my business and stuff started picking up for the first time in my life i started having hope actual fucking hope this continued for a year and a half at this time the rental we were at had a pipe burst and basically ruined the ceiling my landlord being the pos he is took months to fix it and when he did we had to be out of the house for a week this was our breaking point when it came to him and the rental market in the area we decided to relocate 3 hours away that was 6 months ago this is when everything seemed to fall apart i have always been the person that finds the best in everything and maintains a positive mindset even when the house is burning down that flew out the fucking window about 5 months ago i have gained more weight my business is not surviving the move unemployed no friends i feel trapped and the pressure puts an instapot to shame i have eleminated every responsibility possible because i am scared i will fail it is hard for me to get out of bed because i feel like my life has no purpose i truly do not think i would ever kill myself like i stated i am fairly certain its just my invasive thoughts acting up i am strongly against medications it is not that i think they do not work i am honestly scared of the side affects and feel like i am mentally strong enough to deal with the problems without them also i do not trust therapy because i do not believe there are enough subcategories for mental illness i do not want to get be misunderstood or diagnosed with something i do not have due to someone who basis their expertise on knowledge obtained 1520 years ago feel like technology has had a detrimental affect on mental health i do not know what i am wanting out of this post support criticism advice i am not really sure maybe i am hoping someone might read this and find strength knowing its ok to not be ok sometimes maybe i am reaching out hoping someone might have gone through this and can help me regardless i do not plan on going anywhere i know that no matter how hard shit gets no matter how much you think people do not care about you killing yourself will destroy peoples lives that you care about suffer for them so they do not suffer because of you thank you love you
1,whining about my past and current state i really do not know what to write but i somehow have to get this off my chest might be a bit of rambling but i have got nobody to actually talk to also sorry for some mistakes german fellow here okay so a little background story basically since i am 1213 i am 22 now i am suffering from mental problems mostly depression at a time it was also severe social anxiety i have been in a hospital for it for around 2 months i got into it because i admitted to contemplating suicide but basically after getting out it did not really get better why all of that well my parents divorced at a young age my back then stepdad was an asshole nothing was more important to him than his house car and work he is my little brothers dad and i guess i do not need to tell you that my big brother and i were not of big interest for him we had this big ass house but nothing was getting done he was never home me and my brother went to school my little brother was a baby my mom was also working and i had to see her burning out more and more then she divorced him after getting back the strength and i got sucked into a lawsuit he took my little brother and did not bring him back so court appointments youth welfare office appraisers all being at home wanting to speak to me as well my back then stepdad said that my mother was not able to keep kids if this was not enough my big brother and i also never really had the best relationship since his dad never cared about him and he saw how my dad cared about me but my dad also is someone who is suffering from some kind of anxiety and maybe i learned from it upsidedown_face however school was never better i was basically always bullied cannot remember a time in school this was not the case until the last year and that is it i got to know a beautiful girl apparently i caught her eye and she reached out to me three years of a almost perfect relationship before that i only had a guy who sexually took advantage of me it really was a long time i have not been that happy she was beautiful she was smart funny and so on but in the end she left me for another dude this was two years ago and i am still suffering from it not that i want back i just cannot start anything new so let us add trust issues to the list but that is not just because of this after it i tried dating other people but in the end it was them fucking others while being with me trying to get their ex bfs jealous or other stuff like that i kind of got into that spiral of just having meaningless sex with dudes or girls i found on grindr or tinder also i never got to out me and i really regret that but that was a big problem because i realized how superficial a lot of people are i would not say i am ugly i am really not actually from most people i get compliments you are so beautiful or the best friend of my ex said everytime you see toni he is getting hotter i started working out lost some weight and it was good until covid happened and i had to stop it got me into a spiral again i cannot get out i hate my body again i gained weight i hate looking in the mirror in general i just do not like what i see now i wanted to start training again but of course i fell while biking and now my hand hurts it is like whenever something seems to get better some higher entity is like you thought haha what about friends you ask never really had them i met some really cool people when i was with my girlfriend i thought when she broke up they all told me toni we want this friendships to last do not worry just to abandon me and never hearing of them again after a few months even after i reached out multiple times and now well i wanted to start over again moved from my hometown to a new city got into university new city new opportunities new friends well covid was like nope everything was online it seems like i am too dumb for what i am doing i am still only sitting at home wasted another summer and i just wonder will it ever stop will it ever get better slowly i am thinking it will never get better that every high will just be followed by another down that will tear down everything i have built up so far you got money well here is you are washing machine broken finally got a person you like well they fuck someone else finally took the step to a better life well i will do everything that it will be the same in the end finally happy with your body and took the step to go to the gym well gyms are closed now lost 10kg of weight well you will hate yourself either way do not you gyms are open again well fucking fall while biking hurt your hand and and damage your bike so you cannot even bike anymore because you have got no money to repair it and let us face it you need money for a new pc first because yours is broken and you need one for university you need new clothes at least a jacket for when it gets colder i really cannot do this anymore maybe i am just whiny i do not know but in the end that is just a small insight into my life i am 22 now and i am at that point again i wonder if it even makes sense anymore especially when the current state of the world is not getting better either and the worst thing is compared to others looking at what i have reached yet at least looking at my apartment i feel horrible because i should probably feel good about myself because i have got it better i have invested a lot of money into it and i am really happy with how it turned out others would dream of that at that age maybe i just cannot get enough i really do not know thanks for reading though do not know if anyone got some advice or ideas what i can do hope this was not too much but i really have to get this off my chest
1,i will be 40 in six months and have wanted to die since i was 12i failed at life and want to die more than ever edit i am so sorry guys i spent an hour responding to more comments only to have to delete them because i was mistakenly posting from my main account nonetheless i am grateful to each and every one of you and each and every one of your words for the first time in months i do not feel so alone thank you despite all the years of meds and therapy and crisis counseling and being told things will get better you are a beautiful strong woman and everything will turn out wonderfully if you just have patiencei can say that with less than six months until i turn 40 i feel no less depressed than the day i was hospitalized at age 12 for trying to kill myself via starvation i can say honestly that at that point i had absolutely no trauma in my life my parents did nothing but love and care for me i just so happen to have a depressed brainand the beginning of puberty allowed its awakening i was able to make it through high school because i went to a charter school specifically for kids with emotional disturbances but i only made it halfway through college before i had another fullfledged episode of depression and had to drop out i was walking out of classes because i needed to cry for no reason i still lived at home and about a year later my parents told me i need to work the only job i could do one that allowed me to come and go as i please and take time off when i needed it and still be able to support myself was stripping in the meantime i was violently raped by a friend of mine i could nott deal with it so i just went to work the next day like nothing happened with a tampon up my ass so i would not bleed everywhere supressed it as long as i could until again i woke up and decided i wanted to die began therapy a few years laterlast i saw he was happily married with children my fucking rapist got the life i wanted and never had while i was able to move out on my own thanks to dancing after 7 years i was vomiting before shifts and my boyfriend at the time had told me that he would never marry me as long as i was dancing so i decided i was mentally well enough to try school again and graduated one year later with my certification in personal training i spent a few years making minimum wage to build my experience and finally i got a fulltime gig with benefits all the while noticing that my boyfriend still did not seem into marrying me it had been 6 yearshe finally told me we are not financially stable yet even though he made over 100000 a yearbut alright turns out he was cheating on me with a goddamn stripclub bartender i googled his email because i had forgotten his amazon name and ended up finding a whole bunch of shit that devastated me his reaction was to first say i did not think you would ever find that well use a different handle than the one you always use next time then to tell me that i needed to move out told him i did not have the money to move out he said he would pay for the deposit but when i found a placehe could not produce it finally told me he did not want me to leave after all we can work on this blah until six months later when he finally admittedafter 8 yearsthat he did not want to marry me ever i just was not a good enough homemaker i finally asked for help from my one rich aunt got the deposit finally moved out while in the meantime i had been promoted to head pt and trainer for new staff despite the heartbreak at home i actually had a job with a prestigous title for me and an actual successful career i was making enough to pay rent and was on track for another raise until 2 weeks later when i was fired over the phone because one front desk worker said she heard me jerking off a client on an recumbent bike seriously never in one million years would i have ever even thought of doing such a thing but you knowshe was 18 and her boyfriend enjoyed his workouts with me that was enough for her to make sure i never worked there againi was never accused once of jerking someone off when i was a goddam stripper of course with no job and no income i was given one months notice to move out i found a cheap room and was able to get some work at an old colleagues new gym i did not have a lot of hope for the future but i still had a little and then i got covid and almost died from it it is been six months and i am still too weak to walk let alone train too much brain fog to really do any sort of work and only have two weeks of unemployment that i had to fight for left i have no money and no job no man has ever decided i was worthy enough of marriage or having a family with my own body has become a she will of itself and the hypoxia from covid as well as the inflammation in my brain from it has made my depression 1000x worse i tell people i need help physically and mentally but all i have to do is say trump could have handled this betterand they basically tell me i should kill myself because saying mean things about trump hurts their feelings or they are just so tired of the minimal restrictions that they freely admit they just do not care about me or my health anymore because you know people need indoor dining but they do not need me these are people who claim to love me saying these things this is my support system saying these things to me can anyone here honestly say if they were me they would still have hope that things will get better i am not doing another 40 years of this and since covid did not kill me though it came so close i was on oxygen for 6 daysi am nearing the point where i just have to do it myself thanks for reading
1,bought a gun with my stimulus for suicide posting some ramblings here because i feel alone it is long and i apologise for the length do not know where to start but currently i am in airbnbs using what little savings i have trying not to think about commiting suicide i used my stimulus check to purchase a firearm just for the peace of mind of knowing i could do it whenever i was ready and when i realized how calm that made me i decided to post here to see if anyone could give me some advice i live in the desert in arizona but i grew up in california i have always felt alone and suicidal since a child i was raised by my grandparents as far back as i can remember after my mother left to az after my half brother was born years later my half sister was born there after my grandparents passed when i was 16 i had to move to az i have learned growing up i was around dangerous settings and car accidents in infancy and i am worried that also might be a factor in why my brain is wired this way on top of the regular stuff my grandparents were absolutely loving and seemed to try their best to put me in a better environment i never told them these feelings because i wanted to be a perfect son for them in exchange for what they did for me my grandpa was an old school cowboy type traditional conservativebut never once told me i had to be any certain way as you can probably tell polar opposite here in azi have no relationship with my birth father or an idea of what he even looks like yes no photos anyways i was told by my parents that my father went to jail for murdering his girlfriend in ca but he is been out for a few years already somehow and my mother and step father are convinced i am a murderous sociopath that is going to kill them all one day randomly my step father choked me and my mother and him pretty much told me to go because i make them feel uneasy stepfather kept a loaded gun on him in case he had to shoot me leading to my airbnb situation most days at home i kept to myself in my room but in october i went back to california for 2 weeks when my depression was hitting it is peak to see if i had hope or needed closure or something i went back to my hometown and did not feel any pain i was happy for once i was with my girlfriend who i wanted to take to prom back in ca before i had to move and it feels like ever since i left my life was in limbo i want to go back to live with her but i need to find a job there as well as a cheap apartment and it is extremely difficult however she told me she is been wanting to leave home and get someplace for herself as well it is honestly the only reason i have not done it yet but deep down i feel like this will not work out i have this sense of abandonment so i default to isolating myself and suffer because since childhood i have told myself over and over no one really cares about you and it still carries with me and still ruins so many of my relationships but what is really making me finally want to go through with it is that i did gig work so i have been getting stimulus and the pua so basically money to just sit around doing nothing i was living at home with my mother so i saved all the money i have the title to my car 2012 nothing crazy no debt no student loans and a 700 credit score i was always the chubby kid but since covid i have lost weight like 60 pounds smoking weed and drinking water i can get girls i lost my virginity and i am still absolutely depressed and suicidal i even put off losing weight for so long because i was so scared if i got in shape and hooked up with women was not immediately happy no i am actually feeling worse because now what i know self care love is important and a good way to fight depression but i lost that weight paid off my car reduced my debts etc the next goal would be to have my own home but that is just adding time to the clock like i did with my weight problem all of this makes me terrified that what my mother and step father say is true and i should just isolate myself or die i have no family when i was living with my grandparents until 16 no one ever came to visit or help and at their funeral there was mostly friends from the neighborhood i do not know aunties cousins uncles or any of that that abandonment feeling was heightened because of this because my grandparents to me my real parents were abandoned by everyone when they were sick and dying it reinforced the idea that this will happen to me too with any relationshipfriendship i have no one really cares i feel like no matter what life will not get better and i will not be happy just on autopilot bouncing between feelings of absolute torment and apathy i do not want to live for decades this way and i would much rather die at peace not to mention how in my lifetime i would be contributing so much pollution and waste to the world for an existence that is not even appreciative of being alive one other thing is holding me back is that i am perfectly healthy and wish i could give all my organs away i know they have to be on ice but i was planning on shooting myself deep in the mountains at sunset to let my body be given back to nature but my kidneys could help save a childs life so it feels like a waste and insult i am also very scared of dying and there being a hell and eternal punishment i was never really religious but my grandma tried to raise me catholic and that fear is still always there with age my thoughts of suicide went from i hate myself and want to die to i feel nothing and things would be easier for me and them if i was never born i do not keep ammo with me because now i feel like that peaceful mountain death is the only thing keeping me going and as soon i get some ammo i am going on that drive
1,need some advice helping a friend with bpd and more hey i am using a throwaway account as i feel that is the only way i can talk safely about this i am a 28 year old male from europe english is not my first language so sorry if some of the sentences do not make perfect sense i have a female friend for 6 years she is in her early 20s very attractive and very smart person she is the only person that i have considered a real friend for an extremely long time and very important to me we have spoken multiple times about dating but we feel like we love eachother but just met at the wrong time multiple times because there were multiple times initially i got to meet this girl 6 years ago as she was boyfriend of a mutual friend of ours we were drinking out and she drank way too much her boyfriend did not care too much for her so i took care of her and she later said that is her best memory of me i made her feel safe we talked a lot however we got into an argument when they broke up we ended up not talking for 2 years we are both great on ghosting sadly we ended up talking again 2 years later after i messaged her we became friends again quickly and talked a lot mostly online though as i moved away from the city she lives in i admitted that i loved her and she said she cares for me a lot however she is together with someone she sadly ghosted me again because she felt like could not talk to me with her having a boyfriend we ended up talking again 1 year ago in november i once again became friends with her real quick but this time it was different she was about to break up with the boyfriend she ghosted me for she needed a lot of support going through this and i helped her all the way she also ghosted her best friend that she grew up with so i essentially became her best friend we hanged out a lot i told her that i would be moving back to the city once i finished university in summer we talked once again about dating and she said she needs time which i totally understood in january we talked a lot about meeting up which was extremely though as covid was peaking really hard at the time sadly in febuary we part ways i feel like it was my fault this time that she wanted to leave me i always knew she was mentally not all right and i am sure i have some mental issues as well multiple males in my family are bipolar i have been depressed every since my last romantic relationship at first i did not even want to love her because i just felt scared that i would suffer but i could not stop loving her since then i researched a lot about bdp and i feel like if i done that sooner i would have recognized all the red flags and did not drive her away she forgave me in march and said we could try again however sadly we ended up not talking until this weekend we were both baiting eachother to message eachother through various ways but it was beyond obvious both of us wanted to talk one and other i do not think i was ready what was about to come she messaged me on friday very drunk she said she loved my new hair but she also said that she should not have messaged me because this will cause only pain for both of us she said she is doing has been doing horrible she was on a holiday into a neighboring country and she got drugged and raped one night i felt shocked she was already feeling terrible before she way always somewhat suicidal attempted it multiple times when we were not talking she said she is planning to do it again soon i offered to help multiple times but she said she did not want to mix her online groups with her irl friends anymore as it caused her too much pain already she said she only messaged me because she missed the attention i gave her but she would have never done it if she was sober i tried to message her next day but sadly she was not willing to share anything anymore she rejected any of my help and stopped answering the next day i do not know how i can help this person i started reading case studies about her situation the same i read about bdp she said she is beyond saving but i know she is a strong person that just had a lot unfortunate events in her life she really does not deserve any of this i want to check up on her in a few weeks but i am afraid that i would just make her block me or push her further away her birthday is also coming up that i got awesome gifts for but i feel like that is a bit scary topic aswell in june before her vacation i got her a beautiful prepared butterfly in a wooden she will it is really a beautiful piece of art and i know she was obsessed by butterflies however i am scared it would remind her what happened to her she suggested me a book back in winter called the butterfly garden by dot hutchinson the story in one sentence basically is about a serialkidnapper and killer family that kidnaps 16 year old girls tattoos butterflies on their back rape them and live with them until they are 21 and then they are killed and prepared like butterflies in glass shells i am scared that this gift would only make her feel worse but i have some other amazing gifts lined up the issue is i am unsure of her address i am unsure about housenumber and i am sure she would not feel safe me either going to her house delievering it to either i am also just have no idea how to approach her now how much time should i give before trying to contact her i know i would wait forever for her and support her all the way but i just feel lost now sorry for huge wot and i am sure half of the sentences make no sense but some help would be greatly appreciated
1,my collection of grief i have never posted here guess you could say i am a lurker like many others i never thought i deserved to take away from their spotlight i guess like it was selfish for me to think i had it bad when i know others have it worse it seems like a lot of people go from sorrow to emptiness i kind of did the opposite and i am sure this is more natural than i think but now it is like i do not know how to handle it same old shit fucked up childhood fucked family shitty ex girlfriend who said i abused her 8 months after leaving me for a coworker of mine lost family and friends alike even had to see a detective about it no physical abuse but lots and lots of mental stuff from both my mother and that girlfriend do not talk to a big portion of my family now only just recently started seeing my dad again not because he did anything wrong really but i closed everything off and everyone i had to move out i had no money so i ended up having to max out my credit card just to survive car broke down shortly after now i needed a car more debt i became reckless i used to be great at saving money but when your money just goes to making someone else rich while you struggle to pay for food i want something for myself sometimes damnit that was 7 years ago now i still have the debt of a broken man physically in a better place and realistically mentally too but not by much i do not get into a car or walk into a building and imagine all the different ways i could kill myself in there at least not as much my emptiness has overflowed into a cataclysm of dread and sorrow i went to therapy finally quite recently people say money cannot buy happiness but after 8 appointments i got a bill for over 600 dollars whoever says that is either a fool or an asshole after seeing the bill i canceled all further appointments and have not gon back since had not gone long enough to make any real progress towards anything i did however find out that i have a severe form of dysthymia which is basically just persistent depressive and also general anxiety i am sure this is not an unheard of thing but i am basically never not in a state of depression it is almost like being bipolar but with a smaller mood range i am either terribly sad depressed or helplessly hopelessly exhaustively woven into despair that i crawl into bed after work and cry for hours and everytime i think its over and try to get out of bed i take a couple steps and realize that i am not done and have to go back to it apparently it happens at some point in a lot of people lives but i have never not felt this way for as long as i can remember i cannot find true joy in anything my life consists of finding things that might make me happy and working towards obtaining them only to get them and have them become just another thing i think that is how my collection started i collect comic books and figurines books i think my collection is the only thing i can consider myself proud of though it is like i cannot grow myself so i instead watch it grow each new thing a small victory proof that i am alive and building something like some sort of faux legacy to pass on i am meaningless to this world but maybe i will live on in my stuff heirlooms to pass down or something even when i was empty i believed that i just had to push that i could make my life something prove to people who wronged me that i was worth more they would live in the shadow of my success and finally feel the worthlessness i have felt now though i am not empty i am losing hope everyday is this it the meaning of life not surviving not prevailing just existing existing until it is not time to exist anymore every day you give up just a little bit more a personal race to break your last record of perseverance to see how long you can make it how long it takes for you to give up truth is we all would have given up by now i am not sure if the reason is the same for everyone my reason for still being here is because i am worried the afterlife might be boring interesting right this may be our only time and even if it is terrible and nothing good ever happens at least i am not bored i could be reincarnated as an anime protagonist in a world where my life could mean something not without turmoil but with wonder and awe and maybe a harem i do not know do not judge me it seemed like a goofy joke at first reincarnated into a magical world where the problems were different but i could mean something to someone or something surrounded by friends who are cool but also kind throw in some overpowered bullshit powers and i am good to go it started as a joke but i want that i want to be somewhere else i want to be someone else a different world i different plane of existence where i could start over without the problems of before somewhere where it would be possible to truly find peace i want that i do not want to die never knowing what happiness felt like only to live an eternity of regret and emptiness hardships are eternal wherever you go but please let me be able to find joy in things a quote i always like was you can either live a life of meaning or you can live a life of happiness you cannot have both i already cannot be happy a life of meaning makes the most sense now i fear i will not have either
1,this is how i tried to explain to my gamer friend how depression feels like when one of my friends asked me to explain how it feels i was at a loss for words at first but then i remembered that we both like video games and tried it like this thought i would share it maybe people can relate to it edit thank you all so much it means a lot to me that it means a lot to you okay imagine you are playing an rpg and you have been going through the most hellish dungeon ever you have been unprepared underleveled and barely survived then at the end you find one of the most awesome pieces of loot ever it is called the cape of depression it is completely op putting it on would give you immunity to nearly everything the game can throw at you sure there are some negative stats on it too but those seem managable you put it on and it is as awesome as you thought it would be nothing can harm you it does not deflect or defend you against attacks they simply pass through you nothing can touch you anymore swords arrows fireballs does not matter it is all the same to you because you simply do not feel it anymore for some time you feel like a god you glide through the masses and it is exhilerating nobody can touch you you are completely free but the cape has disadvantages it does not just let attacks pass through you but also any blessings healing spells and potions sure it is a bit inconvenient at first but you will manage after all nobody can hurt you anymore so you do not need these kind of things anymore actually you do not even miss them anymore since you put on the cape everything has felt the same anyway and those signs of affection do not have any practical purpose to you anymore so why bother so you continue with your quest wrapped in the cape but somehow it does not feel the same anymore nobody can hurt you anymore so you walk right through your enemies not bothering to fight nobody can heal or comfort you anymore so you walk right through your allies too not bothering to talk it is just you and the cape it is starting to get boring so you think about trying it without the cape but as you try to take it off you look down at yourself and realize that you are still carrying the very same injuries you got in the dungeon in which you found the cape they never healed but you never got any more either then you remember how difficult and dangerous it was without the cape it is easy to remember too after all you have those injuries to prove your point you need the cape so you decide to leave it on at some point things just happen around you without you taking notice anymore nothing can affect you neither good or bad so why bother you are truly like a god now but not in the grand majestic kind of way you are simply not in touch both literally and metaphorically with the normal people around you anymore maybe you are mildly confused and irritated by them why do they act like they do what is the point you do not want to feel left out like a freak so you pretend to still be in touch with them the cape helps you it grants you a 10 to acting and deceiving when talking about yourself and you need that buff because if someone would come to close to you touch you they would see that they pass right through you and realize something is very very wrong you do not want that so you stay away from others which in turn makes you even more distant by the time you have realized that the cape was cursed it is already too late it has become a part of you it is wrapped around you around your true self you are still somewhere inside but around your true self is that vast cloak of nothing that keeps any feeling no matter if good or bad out you have worn the cape for so long that you have forgotten how it feels to feel when you go to your allies and ask for help they do not see what the cape has done to you they only see the old wounds and think you must be in pain they cast their healing spells on you but they pass right through you however all they see is that those old wounds just will not heal so they get frustrated and give up it is just you and the cape edit 2 oh and i while this was not in my original explanation i feel that this should definately be in though some of the worst days are those when the cape randomly shifts your alignment to neutral evil suddenly you can feel again but the cape allows you only one single feeling anger you are angry at the cape for having so much power over you you are angry at yourself for letting it happen and you are angry at your enemies and allies alike you start to remember every single time insult and injury from the small goblin that threw rocks at you all the way up to the lich sending wave after wave of mindless undead after you you remember every single time your tank failed to protect you every single healing spell cast just a second too late suddenly you are the fickle god again looking down on the masses with a smile of disdain on your face for a moment you are glad you feel and then the next day it is over the cape has worked its curse again only to leave you ashamed and guilty for being cruel to your allies and vindictive towards your enemies but fear not the cape is still there wrapping you in nothing that protects you from nothing
1,let go of stress negativity emotional pain 3 years ago i left dubai and moved to a small town in hungary because i fell in love with a girl she did not want to move to dubai so i decided to move to hungary i left my beautiful house high paying job my car my big fat salary and my favourite city in the world behind to move in with my girlfriend but 3 months after moving to hungary she ditched me i was completely broken she left because i was not earning as much as i was in dubai i was in a town where my brown skin was a problem and i did not speak the local language in public i was called a terrorist a migrant and even a gypsy life was tough but i fought myself out of it stress negativity and emotional pain can destroy anyone i was on the verge of suicide but i had a choice to either sulk or lift myself up i chose the latter some of these points mentioned below have helped me big time i hope you guys can relate to it let me know if the stuff here makes any sense 5 steps to let go of stress negativity and emotional pain 1 do not take anything personally if someone says something mean to you it is because they are hurting inside and do not know how to ask for love now if a person is being mean i listen to them look at them with compassion and choose not to retaliatethis typically helps defuse that persons pain 2 replace negative thoughts with positive action as a child i often had negative thoughts about myself and others which would cause me to feel bad many of my thoughts centered on the fact that i did not feel good enough these thoughts caused me a lot fear and anger and stopped me from doing things that i felt would bring me joy when you start thinking negative thoughts about yourself or others tune in to your intuition about what would bring you fulfillment when you devote your energy to things that bring you joy and satisfaction in life there is less energy to devote to negativity 3 love yourself unconditionally because if you do not who will every day i reinforce how much i love myselfwhybecause it feels good and who does not like to feel good one simple way i do this is by telling myself in my head with a smile on my face i love myself unconditionally then i sit in the feeling of love that arises 4 forgive if you do not you are letting your past control and poison you and you are the one who ends up feeling bad i felt so bad in my adolescence as a result of having negative feelings toward people that i never want to feel that way againthe more anger i would feel toward someone the more my life felt miserable and chaotic to forgive people i needed to surrender to the things that had caused me stress they were in the past and they were only still bothering me because i was letting them as a result of letting them stress me out similar issues would arise in other relationships until i acknowledged that i had to do something about it the way i see it now is if i had rotting garbage in my home i would not keep it because it stinks and it is not good for my healthso why would i hold onto negative feelings that are causing me problems in order to let go and forgive i first got into a calm mindseti did this by focusing my attention on my breath which brought me into the present moment next i thought about the person and said in my head i forgive persons name for hurting me and i release any anger and pain i feel about persons namei send persons name unconditional love doing this simple exercise helped me clear so much negativity from my life that i felt like a whole different person you may have to do this many times before you feel comfortable with itit can take a while to fully surrender because we often hold a false sense that these negative feelings are serving us it helps to remember the first lessondo not take anything personally the person who hurt you was also hurting it does not condone what they did but it does make it easier to forgive 5 meditation music music is powerful research shows that music can alter a persons mood and behaviour as well as their physical body that is why in our fastpaced modern world the calming effects of music are so significant meditation is powerful too it can provide clarity and innerpeace when these two worlds music and meditation meet they deliver benefits that impact your entire life listening to calming music can have a positive impact on your meditative practice and your life listening to music while meditating is a reduction in the levels of stress and anxiety when you listen to pleasant and soft music during meditation you will feel calmer and the pressures of life fade outside of meditation studies show that workplaces where meditation music is playing experience much lower levels of stress and lower levels of stress and anxiety than those that have loud music or no music playing at all i personally love this short video which i have started listening to every morning as i wake up head to bed honestly it is a 3 minute video but i listen 40 to 50 seconds of it i hope you guys could benefit from it too
1,severe anxiety derealization agoraphobia depression hello good people i hope you are having a great day and you will have the patience to read my post i am not native english speaker so i apologize in advance if i make some errors i am writing this post which is more like a cry for help during a time when i feel like i touched the bottom of life i have struggled with anxiety pretty much my whole life without knowing it in my childhood everyone around me as well as myself thought that i was just a shy and insecure kid everything started very early in my childhood i was around 67 years old when i had to go to school but could not do it and in many different occasions i felt very anxious and started having derealization which i had no idea what it was back then i would have go home when i felt it and it was going away always when i had to do something new or something where i felt uncomfortable i got anxiety and sometimes derealization almost never i could go on a vacation or on an excursion and relax and enjoy it fully like everyone else the feeling was so strong that i almost always had physical symptoms i would feel sick or had to go to the bathroom and my whole body was stiff could never fully relax my whole life i was involved with sports and this mental issues prevented me from giving my 100 in sports things got better when i was around 12 years old i had many friends i felt very comfortable in school had a lot of fun and almost the whole day i was outside with my friends playing and having fun so all this mental issues were reduced significantly life seemed normal again but then when i had to start in high school everything changed i lost almost all of my friends they went in different schools and everyone found new friends and i could not go to school anymore i could not adapt and the anxiety went through the roof so i started isolating myself at home by the way i live in a third world country so not going to high school is punishable you have to pay a very big fine so the people at the school and some relatives tried to scare me saying that my family was going to pay a big fine etc but this made me even more angry after this life never really returned to normal i spent most of the days at home or in the house of my grandparents had no close friends and never have been in a relationship in my life but i was feeling very comfortable at home at the beginning but very soon it took its toll i developed ocd again without knowing what it was i am sure many of you are familiar with this term and know what it is i struggled with it for many years afterwards plus the severe anxiety i managed to solve it ocd pretty much completely on my own and then the life gave me the biggest punch first my grandpa with whom i was very close got sick and died which had an incredibly big impact on me and 2 months later my father had a stroke which fortunately he survived and recovered from completely but the trauma that i went through was very big in those times i had almost no emotional support i was pretty much left on my own to go through that period i did not want to bother my mother to console me because i did not want to show any weakness in those times when she was too devastated by that event so i went through all that period with my head held up high and then when it all settled the sit hit the fan severe anxiety ocd and derealization came back the derealization became so strong and it still is that i cannot fight it every time when i leave my roomafter that i started having panic attacks which led very fast to agoraphobia now for the last 5 months i am almost everyday 24h in my room with very little human contact i take a shower rarely and sometimes it feels very difficult even to change my clothes so far in my life i have been on 3 different medications and i have seen many psychologistspsychiatrists including hypnotic therapy but the anxiety seems to have won against everything i was very religious pretty much my whole life going to church praying but now i know that i completely lost my faith the most beautiful thing that happened to me in the last few years is the girl that i met few weeks ago online she lives in a neighbouring country and i immediately felt connection and now can say for sure that i felt in love after many many years and it seems that the love is returned but on the other hand what makes me sad and i write this with tears rolling down my face is the fact that with all this mental issues i cannot make her happy i cannot have a normal life even though she says that she loves my company suicidal and selfharming thoughts have been regular in the past few months along with the depression i lost interest in many things that i loved i think i said enough i opened my heart and i do not even know why i did it but maybe somebody can relate and give some help or maybe this post of mine is going to be helpful for other people thank you very much for taking the time to read this and i really hope that all of you struggling with mental issues will find a solution and get your life back
1,could 1 person just read this it is getting harder to pretend i am okay and i do not know how to keep it up edit wow thank you so much everybody i am so grateful please please comment on peoples posts that do not have any comments if you can hope you are all doing well or if not that things get better for you 3 i know this post will be ignored but at least i tried at least i tried to get help from my parents friends school hotlines reddit but nobody wants to help the only person i had left was my bf but yesterday he just said he feels like all he is is a therapist to me it really broke my heart into a million pieces because i do not have anybody else to talk to and he always said it was okay for me to vent to him my parents called me a freak and a weirdo said that i need to snap out of this and get over myself after they saw my stupid blog about my depression when i was 13 i do not know why i made that 13 yr old me was questionable they got enraged when they saw my self harm at 14 they got really mad the tension in the house and the shame was unbearable i could not look at them in the eyes and spent most of my time hiding in my room now i act like i am fine and happy all the time we talk about other stuff and joke and laugh together and its massively improved our relationship i am grateful to have parents i now get along with but it is only because i hide my mental health lately things have gotten so bad its getting hard for me to hide it from them i am forgetting to do things they told me to i am losing things they lent to me they are getting pissed off when i did not mean to i am not doing this on purpose got mad because i did not phone my grandma to thank her for some money of course it came across as rude and i felt so guilty my whole family probably thinks i do not care about them i feel like shit but they do not want to know the truth my friends they all have it bad bad home lives mental health problems every single one of them and i am always trying to help them but when i tried to open up they treated it like a competion and did not even ask what was up with me just said they had it worse i have not spoken to them in weeks because i am so depressed and nobody even checks up on me to see how i am it is hard to pretend i am happy and smiling and laughing so i do not talk to them i am not okay but they are not in the right place to help me they need help themselves it is getting really hard to socialise i talk to my boyfriend everyday and it is just so so so hard to talk and do normal things with him i try to cover up how bad i am hurting but sometimes i crack he said it was okay for me to vent anytime but it looks like i did it too much and he says he feels like a therapy buddy i feel so fucking shit that i cannot even get my shit together school is so difficult i log onto my live lessons and sit there and listen to my tutor saying mental health matters guys when their school counsellor will not even bother to show up time and time again the school counsellor has cancelled on me last minute or during class when we cannot use our phones or just simply not been there my mental health does not fucking matter to the school does it they say its really important we look after our wellbeing so they suggest going out for a walk breathing taking breaths and talking to someone well we already know that is not fucking possible but the other tips are just really basic level things they do not bother to invest deeper into mental health and help people with genuine problems because they might not have superhero parents that can get them to the doctors or therapists they only tell us how to look after our wellbeing when i am doing all those things and it is gone beyond that i am really doing badly and they do not care they just expect you to get on with it so i get told off for not participating in my live lessons well i am sorry that i tried to reach out for help because you said mental health matters and yet i got nothing so you now you expect me to act okay and surprise surprise i cannot fucking do it i cannot switch off my mental health for you school there is no place in school for people like me when they expect you to be motivated high achieving focused participating just always okay and i cannot do it and i know this will transfer into the real world the working world they always expect you to be okay and it is not like i want to walk around looking all miserable but it is just getting so hard to keep that happy mask on all the time i have a university interview coming up soon i do not know if i can do it i am so broken and suicidal that i do not think i can act all enthusiastic and persuade them i would be a great passionate hardworking student when i can barely do my schoolwork and struggle to even get out of bed dress myself and eat there is so many signs i am struggling and nobody cares if you are lucky they will say they do they spit out the cliches give you the useless suicide hotline number and move on with their lives in most circumstances you have to shut up and act like you are okay your whole life there is no place in the world for people like me
1,i am constantly an emotional mess my life has been extremely tough i was brought up by my mother who was suffering through schizophrenia i was passed around my family as a baby and young child because mom could not always look after me never met my father by the age of 21 my entire family had passed away from various illnesses leaving me alone in the world i have suffered with extreme depression and suicidal thoughts all my life i did not have a normal upbringing nor a childhood and i find interacting with people often challenging i realise i am not normal not in the same league with people and people often do things or say things that go right over my head and i make little sense of it or maybe i say things or do things they do not understand either way there is often communication failure and frustration needless to say i have had long term relationships and this year my partner of 10 years decided to betray me unfortunately his timing could not be worse with covid and the housing market being a mess i find myself trapped with him in a toxic and abusive environment he has successfully talked each of our long term mutual friends into ceasing communication with me behind my back and ostracized me from the group so i now find myself totally alone and isolated without a single friend in the world to talk to they all report back to him what i say to them and do not even answer me instead he attacks me for talking to them furthermore this all came to be because he fell in love with a straight guy who is a total loser drug addict and he left me for that without even having any idea if the guy felt the same way or any end game plans just ended our relationship and started hanging out with these new druggy friends of his just to be near the guy you have no idea how hurt i am i have got nothing inside me anymore but sheer hate and bile and negativity i am literally screaming like a wild beast inside my mind i have enough i do not deserve this i have done everything i can for him these last 10 years i wash i cook i clean i love i give great sex we game together we have mutual friends together we go out places and he is seemed like he is been enjoying living with me and being with me and then out of the blue he rips my heart out and sets about utterly destroying my life i have broken down in tears more than once this year and he is literally laughed in my face he enjoys hurting me and i just cannot even comprehend why i mean i have done nothing to warrant this i have never cheated on him never had personal friends outside of the relationship never kept secrets from him he has no motive to have done this he recently had his 30th birthday and he held a funeral for his youth that i was not invited to he came home and flat out raged at me for wasting his 20s on me they he had wasted 10 years of his life because of me i just do not evenmy mind is imploding i cannot cope i am 40 now and i feel like i do not know like i am just some dumb kid without a clue i cannot stop crying i am shaking all the time with nerves and anxiety i am utterly terrified of him i do not mean that he is going to hurt me physically he would not lay a finger on me i know that but i am scared of saying the wrong thing to trigger him by mistake i am walking on glass around him now all the time he is volatile and just so full of irrational hate towards me i am beyond heartbroken this has been going on all year now i have attempted suicide already this year and i have perfected a method that should work with inert gas i have it all under my bed waiting to be used the only thing stopping me is my own selfish survival instincts i have tried mental health services my gp and a referral to a primary care unit for multiple evaluations they say i am likely suffering from post traumatic stress severe anxiety and depression but nothing has changed for me nothing has come of this i am not even on anti depressants despite me repeatedly asking for them i just feel ignored alone unwanted hated heartbroken abandoned destroyed i break down crying at work i just do not see a point do not see a future why am i even there what am i working for money i just do not care anymore all of my life goals and plans revolved around him we live in private rental right now but we were saving for a deposit on buying our own house i had big plans to do it up nice for us he was my forever partner i relied on him and i gave him all of myself in return i was in love i am in love i miss him so much i do not know what to do anymore i cannot think how to fix this i cannot think how to escape this i really really want to overcome the fear of death and get on with it i want him to come home to find my dead body and for him to know he did this he killed

1,i ruined my friendship with my bestfriend and i do not want to live anymore first of all i am sorry if this is wrong subreddit to talk about if it is i will delete it i am not sure where else to put this few months ago i started to have unusual anxieties out of blue i do not get usually anxieties but i did it started at night and i remember that it was specifically about me dying soon later on it would be different things and soon i would have constantly anxieties during days or me just doing whatever later on i would focus too much on little details the way my pfp is the way people talk to me and etc but i focused a lot on how my bff behaved and talked to me she is really important person in my life like i have been friends with her since 2015 or 2016 she is everything to me so i started to get anxious and think that she is ignoring me now talking less to me for whatever reason or liking me less we had lots of fight because of that she was dealing with problems too but i will not talk about them its not my place anyway it got to the point where we fought nearly everyday it even got to the point where i guilt tripped her not on purpose of course when she told me that i was freaking out badly i wanted to kill myself even before we fought was driving me nuts and there was a moment when i planned when to kill myself i cannot swim and i am afraid of pain there was a bridge not far away from where i lived i had a specific day like i think it was on saturday night not many cars drive or people walk at night so it was perfect time for me jump off the bridge eventually i told her my plan and she begged me not to do it which i did not when she told me for the first time that i guilt tripped her i felt shit it was that day when i left the server and thought i could finally end myself i hurt a person that meant so much to me and now i have hurt her the only person that i was supposed to help and be there for her i could not kill myself all i did was just stand on the bridge and stare at the ocean so i left the place back to my own place and decided to fix myself unfortunately i am a piece of shit and did not fix anything we fought again and a lot i guilt tripped her more at one point i thought i fell in love her and maybe that is how i have been i was extremely jealous of one guy talking to her so i really hated him and i started to hate everything that was related to her bf i learned that i was not in love with her but i was being extremely selfish i wanted to be her only reason for her to be happy and not other people i wanted to be her number one no matter what because that is how i viewed her but eventually things did get better to some extent we did fight less or maybe even not that much but it became more of her being afraid of telling me just not to start another fight but i was getting better and i did not go apeshit over her mentioning her bf i was quite fine about it things to me seemed better getting less anxious we even called this monday we had fun we did not fight this week at all but now today she told me she does not want to be my bestfriend it did not help that i was having a mental breakdown before she told me that i would never think i would hear that we have been friends for so long we went through stuff together i have been there for her and she has been there for me she never had an easy life and i have been there for her for everything that was possible i loved her so much i cannot believe this happened at all i do not have a meaning anymore she was everything to me the only bestfriend that i could count on i never told my feelings to anyone than her but now that she does not want to be my bestfriend i have lost everything it may sound very stupid for you guys but i mean it when i say that she was everything for me she brought me happiness just by messaging me she does not think in the future things will be the same or that we will be bestfriends again i have ruined everything i hurt the only peron who i deeply cared i hurt them to the point where they are afraid of me at times i was always afraid of being alone but had high hopes because she was with me i thought that was going to last no matter what i was not myself this summer i put my anger onto her and this is my consequence now i do not have anybody in my life i feared to be alone and now i am alone no one i do not care what happens to me anymore i am fine if i go blind by this point i am having big eye issues and that made my anxiety go apeshit my anxiety is not the reason why i acted like this i should have controlled myself better and not hurt her but i was a dumb shit i am still a dumb shit now i am no one no one to have i am all alone and i deserve all the pain i am having i do not care who i am anymore i really do not care if i am alive anymore the pain is too big now i do not think i can handle it now i made plans for next week to end myself
1,i lost my identity i do not know how to start this or how long it will take but i will try to summarize everything i have lost my happiness i was a joyful boy always happy always smiling always grateful for everything around me but that was only the surface of it depression took over my life followed by anxiety and emotional numbness affected my life emotionally and mentally to a point of no return i wake up with headaches and sleep with headaches the only 5 mins i feel completely free from anything is the 5 min after i wake up my head is empty light as a feather i literally fight with myself to not remember anything and just enjoy the little amount of peace i have left before my nightmare of a day begins i have lost the ability to be happy over the years due to alot of stuff happening my cousin dying of cancer my first and only gf that i have felt genuinely attached to and by the way our relationship comes and goes but i could not stay friends with her and see her with other men it hurt me so i chose to just fade away and am not surprised that has not tried to contact me or anything but just hurtful my aunt who was my best friend and only friend till the 7th grade died and it broke me so much the very first girl i liked for 3 years from the 7th grade to 9th grade whom i worked on myself to be a good man for her in the future when i approached her she made fun of me and humiliated me and it destroyed me by the high school first year everyone know each other i was lonely i made some friends here and there but still did not feel anything then i met my ex gf i mentioned earlier and she broke many many times on and off till i broke it of completely and it hurts so much it is like a fire burning and eating me alive inside out i tried to shake it off find other hobbies but i did not i did not cuz i am not talented i have no hobbies i have nothing that am good at yet i keep smiling to the point where smiling became my hobby i smile in the face of people and laugh at their jokes but that is only because am used to doing it to the point it became like an automatic response a forced and uncomfortable habit my mouth hurts when i smile socializing with my friends when i go out hurts the most all of them are talented and in better colleges than myself i envy them sometimes having great and bright future but then i remember am not as talented as they are my emotional numbness has been increasing lately rapidlyfew months ago my father burned his by mistake i watched as my sister and mother trying to cool his leg and the blood coming out getting creams and first aid i stood there and watched and felt nothing absolutely nothing wondering what the hell is wrong with me at first i thought my depression started when the first girl i liked made fun of me and humiliated me but then i realized i had the depression since i was young maybe because i was alone and had no friends maybe because everytime i force myself to socializing things turn awkward or take a left turn during the pandemic i loved the idea of wearing face masks hiding my face and my emotions was something that made me feel comfortable and confident also wearing a hoodie i was like a ghost walking around not worried about what people think of me i have suicidal thoughts pretty much everyday couple months ago a neighbors daughter was my age 20yrs old committed suicide threw herself from a 12th floor hitting her head in the middle of the street at night and i happend to pass by and see her lying on the ground like that feeling absolutely nothing again i have lost the ability to love to talk to socialize to be happy and enjoy life and am not the type of guy who can move on tried to move from my ex but failed miserably so after many many attempts i gave up trying all i am is a walking talking idiot who is smiling and laughing with people forcibly who cannot stop himself from doing it cuz if i did i will be giving them blank faces and that is way worse that is why i prefer face mask so no one can jude me i do not know why am typing this post but the thought of suicide is always on my mind i do not know if or when i am going to do it but incase i did i wanted to let everyone know my story am scared of myself of what i will become if i let depression anxiety hate anger and negativity take complete control over i do not know what monster i will be i already did horrific things that am not proud of that i do not wish to speak of but they are bad and pretty fucking messed up whoever i have locked up inside is bottling out slowly getting stronger every day i do not know how long i can hold it but sooner or later i will have to let him come to the surface and when that happens i do not think i will be able to heal from it in the end am just a constant in a sea of variables mr robot
1,i have given up since childhood i have never felt truly happy i thought i found it once and i ruined it it destroyed me and i let myself slip into darkness i was numb uncaring and selfish i turned to drugs to cope i did not want to die but i did not want to live i was stuck in an emotionless twilight at the time i did not mind it because i did not hurt anymore a few years back i got a new job and met someone there that i instantly fell in love with it scared me i tried to keep my keep my distance i knew i would ruin it eventually i thought it best to not drag anyone down with me that was easier said than done the more we talked the more i realized she understands the type of pain i am going through i let myself care about her we finally expressed how we feel about each other and began dating we both had our problems and knew what we were getting in to at least i thought so i struggled to overcome my addiction and learn to love again i was honestly a really shitty partner in the beginning i did not communicate well i was absent and distant she stuck it through with me and i became a much better person i owe it all to her she was an alcoholic and when covid began she quit her retail job and spiraled out of control it was a struggle i worked 1012 hour days 6 days a week i would come home to her blacked out almost daily i stuck with it doing whatever i could to help her overcome she ended up in the hospital a few times and eventually tried an outpatient treatment program it did not help after reaching out to her mother for advice she suggested inpatient i was desperate to help her so i agreed i did not want her to be locked away like that but i did not know what else to do i would tried everything up that point her mom gave her an ultimatum go to inpatient willing or have it court ordered she went on her own it did not help she came back even worse disturbed by all the horrifying stories she had to listen to while in there from other addicts she resented me for colluding with her mom one day i come home from work and she was not home that immediately struck me as odd and i tried to call and text her to no reply her phone was turned off there was no note her things and car were still there but she had disappeared i began searching her known hangout spots around a nearby river nothing i was getting scared i called her mom and she had not heard from her we called the police and filed a missing persons report they pinged her phone and it is last location was miles away sheriffs checked it out and nothing the next day her mom tells me she heard from her i was so happy to know she was alright then she told me she was with her abusive ex i felt my heart shatter even still i tried to get a hold of her to understand what happened she regretted her decision and explained she acted on a drunken impulse she wanted to come home i was upset but i understood addiction can make you do terrible things i forgave her and went to get her a couple weeks later she did it again i was angry despite that i reached out to her to make sure she was alright i wanted to know if this is what she truly wanted and if not i was willing to bring her home again she eventually asked me to come get her once we got home i explained that this is going to take time to heal from i still want us to be together but i am very hurt she apologized and eventually i was able to forgive her lately she is been so angry and resentful towards me for my behavior in the beginning of our relationship she keeps bringing up past mistakes things we have already talked about things i have accepted responsibility for and sincerely apologized it does not seem to matter it is like she hates me now she expects her past to be accepted forgiven and forgotten my mistakes however are continuous sources of anger for her and they can never be forgiven i opened up to her recently and told her that i am not well i tried to explain that i have been planning on ending my life soon she did not listen and started getting upset about my past again it is like she wants me to do it i told her that this is not just a plea for attention or to feel sorry for me that i am serious and i am making one last attempt to get help she blew me off and began interrogating me about something in my past at this point my heart has grown cold i am numb again i do not feel that i deserve to be happy that i am incapable of being loved i think it is time to follow through i do not want to hurt anyone anymore one last selfish act the last time i will ever hurt anyone ever again
1,collecting pieces of my shattered porcelain soul i have been meaning to make a personal post for a while it is been a difficult time for me and i have really been struggling lately sitting at my terminal typing this out i am finding my words and sentences difficult to conceive perhaps this is an unsurprising reveal an antithesis of the otherwise happy mask i don the mask that says that i am okay this is unlike my time earlier this year from my situation with whom we shall call lt and i would be doing myself a grave injustice if i were to have specified it as such the root of my current status quo is complex and unending not simply onedimensional but a great web of connected overlapping and intertwined vertices no to contemplate and dwell on the sources of my pain is not why i started writing this post it is not why i had if you are reading this decided to publicize it on the internet expressing myself and delivering my most blatant clear and real cry for help was my reason to be blunt i have lost a lot of motivation and will lately i have lost friends family and most importantly i have lost myself i know that on the surface anyone would be envious of my life i am a wellrespected straighta student who is involved everywhere both academically and nonacademically with my foot in the door all across the hemisphere and connections all across the globe with dozens of open job offers and opportunities to ditch my life and move away and make six figures doing what i love and loving what i do with this and that and so much more and more and more and more i make people laugh and i make people smile i make people feel happiness when they have not in a while and i stay with them and i help them and i am there for them because that is what i do i help people i look like someone who has everything figured out and i guess i do have a lot figured out i am a star student a valued and highlycontributing member of everything i am a part of and i am amazing at my job and i exceed at everything i do i guess i have a lot figured out but i do not have everything figured out to say that i have lost my friends family and myself may be confusing to an outside observer who sees friends and family still loving me and surrounding me and myself still putting on a smile sustained throughout every shared moment bringing laughter and light and happiness to every room i am in perhaps this is nitpicking the specifics of the english language but they are wrong my friends and family still have me and they have not lost me i said i lost them i said i lost myself anyone who is ever felt this and i know there is a nonzero number of individuals who have who do understands what the subtle but important difference is we understand how it is possible for ourselves to lose the people we love and the people we care about without them losing us because it is not a matter of possession company relationship or otherwise it is about identity there are not words for me to describe it there are not words for me to explain it to someone who is never felt it before i have been writing this for hours already and words are so so difficult to come across i have lost everyone and myself this life that i live this life riddled with clinical anxiety depression ptsd and a physical disability is not a life for the faint of heart i walk through hallways every single day not fully accepting that i am me i look into the mirror and see another person this life is not a life that you want to live so please do not be envious of it i am so utterly stressed i love all the clubs and organizations i am a part of and i easily excel at both work and school but it is exhausting when i have so much emotional baggage to carry on my shoulders my ptsds never gotten better my soul is not a golden model it is one of porcelain dropped and shattered and crushed into a trillion minuscule pieces scattered by the winds of time i truly live two worlds one of false happiness and laughter and love and one of the deserted land in which my consciousness wanders a barren wasteland devoid of life myself never truly able to be me eternally wondering struggling and falling this is not something i have only recently begun feeling but something i have always felt only repressed and not allowed to surface for so long i am in so much pain and i do not want to be in pain anymore impale me with a steel hook and savagely tear my heart out i will never function like you i cannot be normal i cannot be happy that is been me
1,i feel like i have to at least try to kill myself before anyone takes me seriously 17f this is long and i feel like i am attention seeking for even writing this but it is how i feel i could never actually do anything but i am tired and do not know what else to do everyone in my life seems to think that just because they do not see me crying 247 i am not depressed but when i do end up opening up and crying they take it personally and blame themselves or me and make me feel so ungrateful that i feel horrible for even trying to express anything in result i usually try and suppress my emotions to keep from bothering anyone and especially prevent making my mom feel bad as she tries her best thankfully somedays i am numb and cannot feel anything at all my mom who i love dearly feels that because i do not pay any bills and do not go to work there is absolutely no reason why i should be depressed which makes sense i guess but my brain apparently does not agree lol i zone out as an escape sometimes and end up in deeper trouble i am weeks behind on my schoolwork and have teachers calling me everyday being patronizing and snippy about the missing work and i hate myself for it i am occupying valuable space in their class and for what i feel like i will never get caught up i just want to be dead or at least in the hospital or something so that they will leave me alone a thought that i will most likely never act on every time i look at my work i get incredibly nervous and cannot think of anything else but failing and how angry they probably are with me my mom is disappointed in me and no matter what i do or say she does not believe me and i end up giving up in the end because i feel like nothing i look like a terrible student which is so different from my previous school years i feel like i try so hard but there is no evidence to support it i really wish i could do more but i cannot i try to force myself but i cannot get much done and i do not know why i am a terrible student dumb useless and cannot complete work on time i have had no motivation for my work or anything else like washing my hair or getting out of bed completely disgusting i know i also have no friends normally people exaggerate and say they have no friends but at least have one or two i have none no one to talk to or confide in i have never fit in anywhere and have social anxiety no one cares no ones ever cared i struggle completely alone and have for seven years i have lost interest in everything i used to love and it hurts so much i think about killing myself almost everyday but i am a coward and would never do it i have asked in the past about seeing a therapist covid makes the process even harder but felt so horrible even asking because my mom said fine but she would have to pick up extra shifts to afford it and that she did not understand why i could not just talk to her because we are close instead of being ungrateful and wanting to rely on a stranger and meds to make me stable like someone with real issues i know she was just frustrated but it is statements like those that make me wish depression was more common and visible like the flu or something so that i would not have to explain or feel weird or bad about getting treatment it will not be until i finally do something actually harmful physical and visible my current self harm which i do not do often is not that i might get help if i can even be helped but i will not and probably never will i feel like nothing and a huge burden at the same time a complete failure and although i try to be as selfless as i can i appear and feel like a selfish ungrateful brat i do not have a bad life and my parents are great so why do i feel this way there have been days where it felt like it could possibly get better but i kid myself every time each year it somehow gets worst i do not really want to die but hate my entire existence and want to get away also i know this probably seems trivial and somewhat whiny i am sorry for bothering you all i did not know where else to put this and it felt somewhat soothing to vent thank you if you decided to read this edit i am typically a very private person so it took a lot to share this thank you all for being kind and giving me advice i am eternally grateful i feel less alone now it felt really nice to finally vent i am staying strong and am not going to let depression win i thought about deleting this but if it helps someone i will leave it up
1,am i a bad friendperson first sorry for my english some grammar might be wanky secondly i recently stuggle a lot because i live alone for the first time in my life in a new town where i know no one and lastly are my thoughts and feelings all over the place because i think i might have undiagnosed adhd and anxiety or maybe i am just weird i do not know i recently got in contact with a very good friend of mine with whom i did not talk with for over a year let us call him ben he wasis one of my best friends i introduced him to my female best friend let us call her alex the first person in my life that understands me so well and shares so many interest with me we all share a common intrest in video games pc and play together often almost daily they both recently broke up with their so and i immediately felt that ben had a thing for alex but i did not think much of it at the time once i confessed to him that i had a crush on him a long time ago and that i would not be aversed if he would feel the same someday knowing fully well that i was in the never ending friendzone but i was glad that i told him anyway alex also was part of that conversation but i do not think she really cared because they started dating 2 weeks later without me knowing while playing with them and talking with them on discord i felt the tension between them to be honest at that time i thought they might make a really cute couple they were sweet to each other and they had so much in commonbut i was more afraid of what would happen once they started going outwould there still be space for me what happens if they break up will i lose ben again i asked ben if he had feelings for her because it was kind of obvious but he did not want to admit it at first because of my confession a few weeks back but i assured him that even if i had a crush on him right now my feelings would not matter if they loved each otheror so i thought a day later my mood dropped i cried and talked to alex about itthat i even wished that the two of them never met because i feel like losing them and especially her she was really considered and assured me that she would always be there for me and that i am the first friend she ever felt so connected with i was happy but felt bad for having such thoughts i wanted them to disappear but they did not not then not now a week later i realised that talking to her made me feel better and less anxious but a day later they announced to me that they were dating i told them in all honesty that i was happy for them they are so similar and cute together it had to happen but i also told them i was jealouswhy i do not know if it is because i myself am single of if i really havehad a crush on ben or that i knew i would spend less time with alex from know on i tried to hide my bad feelings and started to mask them always staying happy and understanding i think rather successfully but the last three days were toughthey started to hang out without me more often something completely normal and things that couples should do as much as they wantis what i am saying and should be feeling honestlybut i feel alonei do not have many friends i struggle with asking others to hang out ben and alex are the ones i spent 90 of my time with and its hard for me to see them be happy without me all my thoughts are all over the place i wish for them to be happy i love them both so muchbut on the other hand i wish they never met or leave me behind they do not realise that i struggelbut that is because i do not want to tell them i should not be their stepping stone i should not be like broken glass laying around themmy feelings should not matter when they want to be alone or if they ignore me because they are freshly in love and only have eyes for each otheri understand i was there toobut it hurts i cry for the third day not knowing what to do i do not want to burden them i do not want to hurt them but i feel lost lonely and worthless am i a bad person am i a shitty friend i do not want to be the special snowflake that needs special care because she cannot keep her feelings in placemy depression keeps getting the better of me and my anxiety takes overi feel like disappearing foreverbut for what reason this is no reason to make me feel like dying it is a stupid reason and i want to cast these feelings aside but it seems impossiblehelp
1,looking for advice worried about so is health using a throwaway account for privacy reasons i am m30 really worried about my so is f29 health and could really do with some advice i will put a tldr at the bottom i am not sure if any of this content may be triggering so i apologise if it is some context we have been together nearly 10 years lived together for 6 before that we did long distance for 2 years long distance was hard and during that time my so was going through what she calls a hypochondriac stage in which she was always worrying about her health and scared she was going to get ill after we moved in together that worry subsided and things were ok i suffer from mild anxiety too so we both had our bouts every now and then but great other than that she would always think very low of herself though especially her appearance and her weight whenever we went anywhere 910 times she would have a break down about what she would be wearing which often made us late or led to an argument or general stress fast forward a few years just before covid she suffered the loss her step mother who was not even 50 this was obviously devastating but did lead to her and her dad becoming closer then covid hit and as such she has never fully had time to grieve for her step mum on top of that in june her dad announced that he had met someone else in november he said they were moving in together two weeks ago he announced they were getting married the way that he announced all of these was either very nonchalantly over zoomphone call or in a very grandiose way expecting congratulations i am sure obviously my so and her sister are appalled and her dad does not quite seem to understand why on top of that he is so wrapped up in his own life that he is not taking the time to ask how my soher sister are feeling about it is very messed up and i am furious at him so that is two reasons why she is feeling particularly stressed at the moment the third is work we are both key workers and as such have been going into work throughout the last year when others were wfh on top of that her work has been insanely busy and she is working on average 11 hour days and the work still is not done the team she manages are not pulling their weight and management from what i can gather seem quite useless and keep promising solutions but never deliver she does not want to quit mainly because finding a job in this uncertain climate will be stressful too and in the somewhat likely event that redundancies are made it will probably be a first in first out situation her day of anxiousness usually goes as follows wake up feeling stressed about work and about what to wear will sometimes have a break down at work overloaded with workload will go to the bathroom to cry in the evening will come home stressed after a bad day at night will worry about sleeping and as a result will often have a big break down if she cannot sleepgets woken up these break downs range from having trouble breathing to hurting herself thankfully never seriously but she has given herself scratches and bruises etc additionally there are certain words that might trigger her like if i mention anything about breathing her chest goes tight or if i suggest we go to bed earlier she becomes panicked about sleeping i have suggested apps such as headspace but she says they do not work and she does not want to go on medication i am really worried about her and feel awful that i do not really know how to help i am worried that one day she is going to badly hurt herself she has never expressed anything about being suicidal so i am not worried about that more just badly hurting and also worried that quite frankly she could give herself a heart attack or something it is also obviously having an effect on me as every evening i am on edge not wanting to trigger a reaction in anyway and feel absolutely rotten if i do but admittedly the whole situation also makes me feel very angry not necessarily at her but just likewhy is this happening i hope that makes sense and does not make me sound like an asshole i am just at a loss with what to do i love her more than anything and am just so worried about her so any advice could be greatly appreciated thank you tldr so is having panic attacks nearly every night and day is extremely stressed and i am worried about her heatlh
1,i am literally all alone and there is no hope for my future this is going to be extremely long so just a headsup i was abused from 814 years old when my mom married my stepdad my mom was an amazing person and she always did whatever was best for me she had no way of knowing that my stepdad was a horrible person because he was actually really good at hiding it by acting all sweet and kind he would do it in secret when my mom went away on business trips and he psychologically messed me up so much that i was scared to tell my mom just so you know how bad it was i will tell you something he did my precious pup at the time was my best friend and i would always go to her for comfort whenever he was abusing me he noticed how much she meant to me so he started grabbing her and beating her infront of me while i pleaded with him to stop he killed her like that one day he just told my mom she ran away or something my mom started becoming suspicious and eventually found out she divorced him and got a restraining order the next 2 years were the happiest years of my life i got a absolutely gorgeous girlfriend that was way out of my league and made some amazing friends i started highschool and things were going great then my mom got sick the nerves in her legs started to rapidly deteriorate or something so she could not walk she lost her job and became very depressed she unfortunately ended her own life i broke that day luckily i had my girlfriend and her parents that did everything they could to make sure things were going to be ok for me since i do not have any other family it was always just me and my mom my grandparents died when i was 5 and my dad died when i was 2 so i never really knew him my girlfriends parents let me stay by them and they were willing to pay for my schooling and everything it was hard getting over my moms death but i was able to get through it thanks to my girlfriend for a while things were going ok again but then my friendgroup started experimenting with drugs and my girlfriend was not having it so she separated me from them it was against my will but i am happy that she did i did not have any friends but my girlfriend was my best friend anyways and she was more than enough for me once again things were going well for a bit until covid hit and my girlfriends parents started struggling with money i felt really bad since they would not have struggled if it was not for me living with them i started eating less and doing everything i could to save them money unfortunately it did not really help they are still struggling a bit what i am about to tell now is where my whole existence just shattered my girlfriend broke up with me i will not explain why but the reason for it was understandable and i will never hold anything against her like i said before she is way out of my league and she was the most perfect girlfriend anyone could ever dream of while i am just an average guy that had issues because of what i have been through and all of the mess that follows me so we broke up and now i am all alone i lost the only person that i had in my life and not only that but she was the one that was keeping me together to add insult to injury her parents suddenly just did a complete turnaround and they suddenly do not give a shit about me anymore they want me out of their house by january next year my ex has pleaded with them to be less cruel but i asked her to just leave it because i do not want to be the reason for them fighting i am only 18 and my finals are literally right around the corner i do not have anywhere to go i am all alone without a single cent to my name and i am trying to get through a break up still i cannot begin to explain how i feel i do not care what anyone says about oh but there is help and you can get through this because i literally cannot my entire life has been slowly cracking and crumbling and now it is finally collapsed i am only 18 years old all alone no money no job and soon i will not have anywhere to go i will be homeless everything is out to get me right now and there is not anything i can do i am going to go and kill myself soon the sad part is that even if i do nobody would care life is fucking shit thanks to whoever actually read all of this i guess i am just hopelessly trying to leave any kind of legacy behind that i possibly can goodluck to everyone else that is still dealing with life and all it is bullshit
1,i am too fucked up i just exist i doubt anyone will care to read this they never do i do not want advice i do not want to hear that my problems are not a big deal while you stand there with your success stories and your dating histories and your loving partners i do not want to hear your stories about how you found your so is when this is specifically a major part of what is wrong with me literally a simple this is what helped me would be nice not trying to make me feel worse i do not want to hear the same bullshit about loving myself i barely even have the energy to write well i want to vent about how much i hate myself how fucked up i am i have lost 10 years maybe more than that to porn addiction i do not know if i walked in on my parents or if i was exposed to sexuality at a young age but i have been masturbating since long before i even hit puberty and then i discovered porn which leads me to now a porn addict trying to break his habits by only masturbating 3 days a week and then that is only turned into masturbating multiple times a day it is fucked my relationships up i can make friends guys call me cool and women call me sweet but i just i am too scared to escalate sexually and romantically i cannot stand up for myself so people walk over me i am afraid of taking risks i am a virgin at almost 23 i do not have a car cannot even drive never held down a job trying to lose weight but making no progress never been to a bar only been to one party never hooked up never had a relationship the only things i have going for me are my writing and my drawing and even then i am losing interest in those as well i do not blame women i do not blame men either it all lies with me my family is not any better i have tried talking about this to them multiple times i can predict exactly what they say this too shall pass believe what you want to believe if you believe it will not happen it will not yeah great thanks for the help and then there is the verbal abuse from my narcissistic shrew of a mother and the complete apathy of my father who constantly tells me he will have my back but never seems to step up when i truly need him but he is happy to yell at and threaten me every time i try standing up for myself against my mother every time i try to leave they threaten to call the cops i have nowhere to go no source of income i am a fucked up broken weird piece of trash who drags the few people who care for him down with his negativity they are better than me none of them deserve me i feel this void in the center of my stomach and heart wherever i go and now that i have spent all day reading through reddit seriously every time these moments of depression happen every post i see has to be about sex and dating and relationships i feel even worse so much worse than yesterday i cannot forgive myself for the things i have done in the past i sabotage myself every single time in my worst moments i have these thoughts these fucking fantasies of tying a wire to my neck and the other end to a car and then letting the wire hang me and hopefully cutting my head off all i do is exist i cannot live like this normally i do not feel suicidal but now the thoughts are coming back want to know the funny thing if i die people will just go that sucks pass the apple juice chalk me up to a statistic and forget because nobody gives a shit about worthless men who cannot keep up with the rest of them i do not even know why i wrote this nobody is going to notice or care people rarely do anyways edit i am seeing a therapist online edit 2 i cannot say i am feeling better than i was yesterday when i posted this but a platinum a gold silvers so many kind comments i truly do not know what to say i was not expecting this to get so much traction and i am so close to crying at seeing so many people reach out and care i will try and respond to everyone when i can just thank you everyone for helping me feel a bit less alone edit 3 well i do not know what to say i was okay for a few days after posting this now the weight in my chest and the bad thoughts are creeping back in again they just are every single time i think i will get better and then nothing at all it is like my body wants to be depressed now i am just fighting myself i want to surrender
1,staying busy to stay out of my own head stressed and overwhelmed just do not cover what i am feeling i have immersed myself into my career at the company i have been working with for 5 years this march i am in my mid 20s and in a position that everyone said i could not do when i was promoted the first 3 months were rough but i learned from my mistakes and got comfortable and do my job well the first year and a half in management i was always stressed but i was not as overwhelmed as i am now and i seemed to enjoy myself outside of work more i got to a point around the 2 year mark in management where i was super comfortable where i was and was working regular hours 45 hours a week or so when coronavirus hit it was like our workflow increased with less people to work and more demand on us as managers i went through one of the hardest summers working with minimal help doing more projects then ever follow this by hurricane sally worked 60 hours for a few weeks customers constantly not being understanding of the situation and only making me feel like i was failing them to no fault of my own the next few months my workload seemed to grow exponentially but i was unable to focus and keep up with where i know i need to be i eventually go to the doctor and test for adhd and get prescribed adderall i should add i was already taking adderall at times for a month or two prior because i could not focus at work whatsoever the adderall helped me more then i could have hoped i was now as high functioning as i used to be and was knocking work out it has leveled out some now and i feel normal on it now but still get positive results out of it now i am in the same boat as last spring 40 of employees i need to keep up with workflow certain material is hard to come by or non existent constant weather issues and customers just keep approving work i am working almost always 7 days a week i am up by 445 and will not get home until 5 or 6 on average but i have a few days every week i work till 7 or 8 to finish a job or get material i now even spent my money to setup an office at home so i could work in my free time just to try and catch up we are working skeleton crews and seems there is no end in sight to the labor shortage a lot of the responsibilities i feel so overwhelmed and stressed by are ones i have taken on myself because no one else was i have an ownership mentality and treat this business as it was my own now that is the work part of it i had an almost 5 year relationship with the girl i was in love with that ended in me heartbroken and afraid to trust any one i kept to myself but talked to a few women here and there i found one that i had any real connection with and that ended as a failed relationship i fell more in love with this woman then i ever felt with my previous girlfriend and was in a dark place when she left follow this by months of me feeling like i was not enough and no one i wanted wanted me i have a handful of good friends and a couple that are one of a kind but i always feel like i am bothering them or just there to be there but i know this is me overthinking and all that i also rented a house with my best friend that has turned into a nightmare cannot say anything without him getting defensive no help around the yard or house constantly taking advantage of me being nice he was also working with me and turned into a bum and was missing work constantly and always so negative to be around so add all that stress at work and come home to a house you hate the other person there and have to dread being home until he moves out the past two months have been the hardest i have ever dealt with mentally and physically i am working 1012 hours a day and coming home and putting proposals or schedules together i feel like i cannot take a day off much less a whole weekend its like we are batting against the odds and something goes wrong every week but we are also doing great and revenue out the wazoo all while working salary and not being compensated for the overtime i feel like i am about to explode every day i feel like i am about to have a meltdown and crash mentally my mental health seems to have its days some are great some are just days and some days i just want to stop how can i cope with all this stress that i take on myself and cannot leave at work

1,work related stress is ruining my life i work as a manager in retail for background i am only 21 i have had anxiety all my life and i was also diagnosed with bipolar depression last year i am also a college dropout i have worked seasonally at this job in 2017 then came back again in 2018 they decided to keep me and eventually i worked my way up to a manager position earlier this year at the beginning i did enjoy working here and helping people out but i have been recently feeling extremely stressed and burnt out from work as a manager i have a long list of tasks to do everyday while managing others and dealing with customers i would say i am a hard worker and getting tasks done is normally doable for me the thing that gets me is having to deal with people especially as i am an introvert and work full time so i have little time to recharge and with the holidays coming customers are very aggressive and it triggers my fight or flight instincts i get frustrated when people come up to me to ask a question as it is disrupting my tasks i need to get done which i feel really bad about it just feels like an instinct reaction to me that is hard for me to control in the past few weeks i think the stress has become enough for me i have had multiple people threaten to call corporate about me for me simply following the rules one of those people actually did call corporate about me and lied about the situation i had a woman come up to me acting passive aggressive towards me my anxiety normally shows itself as anger or frustration which has become difficult to hide and put on a front for others to see got a complaint to my boss from her about me and how i did not say you are welcome for showing her where something was on top of that we have another manager who has been causing issues as well as forcing me and others to have to alter our hoursschedule the final straw for me was today when i got yelled at by my district manager for not completing something i tried to hold my tears back but towards the end i could not hide my shaky voice she confronted me about it and i broke down what really pissed me off is i know she does not care about my stress she seemed more worried that there was now a crying manager it is just a bunch of little encounters that nag at me when i try to sleep at night they build up and i just exploded today i already know that i want to leave this job but i really like my store manager and i would feel bad for quitting when we are about to hit peak season the pay is also good and i am trying to save money to move out but the stress seeps into my personal life and i am isolating myself and neglecting my life aspirations i want to be an artist but in order to work my way there i need to be creating but by the time i am off work i am exhausted mentally and physically i have become pessimistic and cynical again i feel hopeless that if i do not make a change soon i will be stuck in customer service forever which makes me feel suicidal i have been looking for other jobs but nothing seems like it would be better also when i get complaints i reflect on it for days and think about myself as a person and how people see me i feel terrible for not being more welcoming and friendly like i used to be but at the same time i am angry at the customers for being rude to me when it comes to my mental health i was in therapy when i started the job but left in the beginning of the year because i was doing well i decided i am going to go back to therapy to deal with my anger and stress but now i feel my anxiety and mood swings coming back i worry that all of the stress will trigger a depressive episode which for me is debilitating the stress has also triggered mania for me before i just feel like i cannot be a manager anymore and i want to leave the customer service industry forever i am just scared to do something about it i know this post was long but it is been a rough month for me i do not want to bother my friends about my problems but i just needed a place to rant until i can get a therapy appointment i also wanted to hear if anyone else has experienced this stress and burnout from work and how they handled it i have been hysterically crying all night and i just cannot take it anymore
1,my ongoing journey with stress and how to cope i find stress to be like most things in life good in moderation i have found myself in many stressful situations at work that have forced me to focus on what is important and to get it done with too little stress i find i have no motivation to move forward too much stress or the wrong kind of stress can be debilitating and possibly detrimental to your health there have been many times where i have stressed myself out over what ifs that i end up saying fuck it or i end up in a ball on the floor sick to my stomach whether it is going out by myself to see a friends band talking to a girl or reaching out to others when i need help and my mom has stressed herself out to the point where she is had panic attacks in the past it was not until the past few months that i have come to understand stress or at least come to an understanding that helps me for me stress boils down to a conflict between the way things are and the way i want them to be for example right now i am trying to launch a side business maintain my 95 help my wife with our 9 month old son and train for several up coming endurance events i want things to go smoothly and find time for everything but life has other plans a couple of months ago my team was working on a big release for our product and i had a pivotal role there were some nights where there was never a break i would put in a quick workout after work cook dinner for my family try to make some progress with my side business and after my son went to bed i had to do some work for my 95 i felt overwhelmed i felt guilty that i was not doing more and most of all i felt like i was not good enough i was not a good enough employee i was not a good enough entrepreneur i was not a good enough husband and i was not a good enough father there was one night where i skipped dinner and just cried in bedi had two options 1 let the stress get the better of me and drop some of the things i am trying to do or 2 figure out a way to cope for me the first step in coping was mindful meditation where i learned that i am not my thought and i am not my emotions i learned to quiet my mind and focus i learned how to separate myself from emotions i am not saying that emotions are bad i still feel everything but i do not allow them to control me or send me into a tail spin anymore my second step was realizing that the mental physical and emotional selves are interconnected and can go into a feedback loop example i had a call recently about my side business that i was nervous about as the time for the call drew closer i got more nervous then i started to think who do you think you are to even try doing this which fed into my nervousness to the point where i felt queazy if i had allowed it to keep going i probably would have made myself sick i stopped myself when i realized what was happening used some exercises i learned in my meditations once i was able to calm emotions i focused my mind to preparing for the call giving it no room to explore what ifs it was not until later that i realized that once i was calm and focused my stomach settled as well my third step was to learn how to start gaining control of my mind body and emotions one of the techniques i use regularly is nasal breathing did you know that breathing though your nose and into your stomach engages the parasympathetic nervous system the sympathetic nervous system is responsible for the fight or flight response while the parasympathetic nervous system is more related to restoration and digestion so what does that mean when you engage the parasympethic nervous system you short circuit the sympathetic nervous system effectively halting the fight or flight response as an added bonus focusing on your breath takes your mind off of the situation for the moment helping to calm down and focus once you return your attention to the situation at hand i still have times where i get stressed and depressed but i know have steps to cope with it sometimes it is a matter of lightening my load and other times it is changing my focus from what if to something tangible to move myself forward i know how debilitating stress can be and i hope my experiencesongoing journey can help
1,my girlfriend has racist parents sorry if this whole this is all over the place so am a senior 16 years old and i have this girl that i am madly in love with and she is crazy in love with me aswell i met her a year ago and for me it was basically love at first sight the first week we knew each other we would stay up and facetime all night till we fell asleep and i do not even like facetime to begin with but i just could not get enough of her i found out probably a week or 2 after i first started liking her that her parents and the whole family do not allow their children to date poc but i just did not care because i was so in love with her and wanted her to be with me so i kept pursuing her and eventually got her to fall in love with me we were just friends with benefits just kissing and cuddling and kept it a secret from our friends at first but eventually ended up telling them but when we go out in public or where there is people she will not even hold my hand or even hug me i am a huge physical touch person if people could see it happening and i know she was paranoid of her parents finding out but i just feel like she is embarrassed to be seen with me in a bfgf type of way like we were at an amusement park an hour and a half away from our house and i rarely even could get a hug from her or hold her hand without her walking ahead she is not allowed over to my house anymore maybe because she get home late by just a few mins every time but the only time i can see her and be able to hug her or anything is when our friend group hangs out because she is too scared or embarrassed i think to hug in at school where people can see it just sucks that the person i am in love with and is in love back with me i cannot even see whenever she has tried twice telling her parents that she likes me which they did not allow because i am black but everytime she gets in trouble for it and almost got her car and phone taken aswell just because of that they are obsessed with our friend who is part hispanic but they do not care about the fact that hes part hispanic because he is mainly white i just feel like shit because i have to be judged for my skin color which is something that i cannot even choose but that automatically makes me a bad person to them i had a good first impression on her parents i had even offered to help them clean up when she had us over but obviously that did nothing but i just do not know what i am supposed to do because she wants me to wait until she is 18 because she thinks that she can convince her parents that dating a black person is not wrong but what does not make sense to me is why they would allow it in a few months rather than just now and everytime i ask her how she will change them she does not give me an answer she just tells me to wait until she turns 18 and i do not know if i should or not because my other friend who has similar parents said that they would not hang pictures of their grandkids up just because they were mixed i do not want my children to have to be judged like that i wish this upon no one the way you can be with someone you love because of your skin color its a horrible feeling i just want to talk to her parents and try and convince them that there would be nothing wrong with being with me but she will not let me talk to them and i have been trying to for almost a year now i just do not know what i am supposed to do i do not know if i should wait or not because i am not convinced at all that she can change her parents and she will not give me a way that she can so i have no reason to believe in her i want to but i cannot when she has nothing i started hating the fact that i was born this way for a while but got over this i just think about how different things could have been if i were just born white everything would be so much easier i just need advice on whether or not i should stay with her or not we are not dating but we are just friends with benefits i guess it just sucks please help me i do not know whether its worth the risk of waiting around for something that seems like 0 change of working or just trying to get over her and see if someone else has interest in me that does not have racist parents sorry for how long this is but thank you to everyone that helps
1,there is no space for people like me typing this out feels so painful and pointless there is no space for men like me in this society men who do not fit in this societys definition of handsome or beautiful or sexy it does not matter if you are a cheat or an abuser a 2530 bmi with a nice looking face is the free pass by now you have decided put in one of those boxes called incel or something similar i understand that i would also have done that too a few years back god i do not even have the energy to tell the complete story and you do not have the time either long story short my ex came in to my life 12 years ago to escape a mentally and physically abusive relationship and we found happiness proper happiness among the maddening chaos of med school and utter hopelessness of everything else we shared laughter and tears she loved me i loved her it is not easy loving someone in a country we live in people around us used to consider us constantat least those 3 or 4 people who are my friends although she was my only best friend i say this again she was the only person in my 27 something years of my life who was kind to me we shared each others trauma she became my entire life and i was her entire life too at least for 7 years or so then she walked away one day it is not you it is me out of the blue we almost got married almost over the years i have always been proud of our fidelity and loyalty and considered them to be the forte of whatever we had i guess happy people look beautiful women approached me everyday mostly because of my career i never looked sideways she walked away to be with a friend from her med school in a matter of days i heard that he dropped her then girlfriend on a single day notice he had practice my entire world collapsed in a matter of moments i entered my hell i have been here for the last 45 years no sleep cycle no one to talk to no respite i have literally spent weeks or months in complete solitude not even my parents talk to me when i say talk i do not mean long conversations i have not heard a hello or a good morning or a happy birthday in these years i stayed entirely mum for weeks at a stretch i tried to kill myself 3 or 4 times all i think of is a way to die peacefully but she kept coming back quite a few times this new guy supposedly abused her verbally and physically but she went back because he was a poor thing not economically his parents are filthy rich and he does not feel any moral obligation not to use that money he is a poor thing because he suffers from liver disease due to excessive drinking and drugs did i mention that i am the prude who does not smoke and drinks socially literally twice a year on average oh and she accused me of emotional abuse and made up things so that she could justify going back to him i am guilty of letting her repeat this cycle quite a few times i love her i cannot help it only a kind word from her mouth soothes my soul i had built my world around her bit by bit i forgot all the childhood trauma all those bullies all those unkind words i forgot i was not beautiful she made me feel beautiful i worshipped her i was so thankful to god for finally making me happy i thought it was our happily ever after and then i lost everything i cannot face myself in the mirror people do not approach me like before because they know something is broken and the rest of them does not believe that we separated so here i am typing this fucking thing out the new loser creep there is no sympathy for people like me in this society i have tried to hate her with everything i have i could not i cannot i just hate myself more for not being enough now i dream about my death in vivid details i was the quite nerd in school she made me come out my cocoon and now i have nothing to survive i have not smiled or laughed in 4 years i have suffered death of loved ones and more misfortunes i have been backstabbed by people whom i considered to be close from a promising academic talent to a useless recluse i do not think i can be a good doctor anymore if you read this thanks for listening mental health care is not available where i live thank you for reading this
1,broke up with my m23 ex f23 exactly a year ago and i still cannot seem to cope with the reality and move forwards so i am not sure if my story would fit the motif of this sub but i cannot seem to find any other places that would help me otherwise hopefully this would be the place my ex and i broke up at the end of august exactly one year ago after being in a relationship for two years we shared the same friend group studied in the same department had affections for each other and what meant to happen happened now i was not a great partner by any mean even though she was everything to me and i blame myself every single day for letting it happen i completely understood her decision for dumping my ass it just hurt so much that even after one year i still cannot move forwards the whole shenanigan happened during my senior year and it certainly affected my dissertation work very badly for a few months afterwards i managed to push myself and come to school regularly to work on my thesis i worked in a lab for my thesis statement there were many other issues parts of it due to the fact that i was not into the academic by any means and i had skipped a whole year previously to work part time jobs just because i disliked the subject so much this gap year specifically and the differences in academic motivation were big reasons why she dumped me the other was seeing her and her new partner she found someone else immediately afterwards in the same faculty that we were in on a daily basis and it just hurt my weak ass so much that i would not be able to concentrate at all for the rest of the day so in order to distract myself from the facts mostly i found myself using tinder it is kind of a meme where i am from hopefully to find a friend a partner of some sorts this was going on for a few months having met a couple of really nice girls before i realized i was no good to them and what i was doing is selfish and unhealthy so better off just to keep the affliction to myself and not put it on other people now moving forwards because of that realization in addition with my suffering in school i decided to quit school entirely hopefully to come back someday quit my part time job not like i was able to work properly anyway and found myself stuck inside for the past 7 months or so i also stopped chatting and seeing my friends all together i share a small friend group of 10 11 people in college with my ex and that is about it i studied high school abroad so no bff around i am a dumbbell at keeping contacts as well she is a regular chatter and i cannot put myself in any further emotional pain especially when she suddenly decides to talk about her now partner in our group now i am not an outgoing individual and ever since my failure at studying abroad i love medicine and was hoping to continue studying abroad after high school but failed to do so due to financial issues so i am back in my country doing the complete opposite of what i like i started to develop a mild condition of depression it came to my exs recognition too but she wanted nothing to deal with it it finally crossed the line after the break up in addition to all the stress i got from school and family i sought a diagnosis earlier this year and was on medication for a few months though having known the conditions of mental health support in my country and the financial situation my family is in i relied on the medication alone and it has not helped just one bit i realize this has been quite a rant and some of you may call me weak which i agree a hundred and ten percents by the way i just helplessly felt the need to let this pain off my chest and hopefully get some advices in return but otherwise i truly appreciate your reading and maybe somehow i can manage to get myself together in the near future if not then it was nice knowing you all tldr high school goals shattered due to financial problem back to nam disliked college and the chosen academic found a girl broke up due to differences in academic motivation fell into depression and have been selflocked inside ever since found ways to distract myself but to no avail cut off all contacts and medication is not helping help
1,i 24 f got dressed and did a bit of my makeup to meet up with a friend at a coffee shop i am in the middle of a depressive episode and dealing with some great difficulties in my personal life she did not show up this was my attempt to reach out update sorry in advance i am on mobile and this is long i really was not expecting this amount of support and kindness from so many people thank you all for the uplifting words and thank you for the rewards i would like to first address any concerns about meeting up during the pandemic my friend and i made plans to meet up at a coffee shop buy a quick cup of coffee and then immediately head to a park nearby in separate cars the coffee shop is on small a military base so that cuts the amount of people that were in there down by a lot i went ahead and grabbed coffee and then waited on a bench outside of the shop for around 30 minutes or so before leaving i stayed 6 feet away from others and wore a mask the entire time i played it safe and went by the rules next i would like to say thank you to those who have helped me realize how big of an accomplishment it was for me to get to the coffee shop it really did take a lot of effort and i appreciate the reminder that it took strength i did not know i had i also want to thank those who have expressed empathy towards my friend she is going through a rough time and has been since long before the pandemic started i was not angry at her because i understand that she is struggling too i was just really sad and disappointed because i have only seen her once since last year it was more of a bummer than anything and i just needed somewhere to get it off of my chest so i came to reddit kind people of reddit you did not disappoint i am going to continue being her friend because she is very dear to me knowing the kind of person she is she probably truly forgot there was a potential miscommunication or she may have had something come up that she could not get out of it would have been nice to get a bit of a heads up or an explanation but i have not dwelled on it too much she will reach out when she is ready to if not then i understand that too i have been in therapy and medication since 2018 and recently sent a cease desist letter and went no contact with my mother as a result of that i have not heard from my dad since it happened i also live states away from my childhood friends and what is left of the family that supports me not many people i am better off being out of that toxic environment but it is still a grief process losing people that are still alive i have also been grieving what could have been if i only had healthy and supportive parents i am also struggling with my marriage i am a military spouse and it is hard being so far away from the little support i have states away my sisters i will not go into detail here about my rocky marriage but it is been traumatic and hard i have not gotten much support other than therapy and the support my younger sisters have been capable of giving i am in the process of filling out divorce papers and working with an attorneys office to explore my options i also had surgery at the end of october to repair a hernia it was not too big of a deal and my sisters came from out of town to visit during my recovery but it did knock me down a bit emotionally because i was restricted from carrying anything over 20 pounds that meant i could not hold my toddler who is 30 pounds and that was really hard on both of us it just would have been nice to be able to have hung out and talked to the one friend i have here about everything going on it honestly would have been nice to talk about things that have nothing to do with all of the crap that has gone on this year too it is okay though life will carry on and there will be better days i still got my coffee got outside then came home and hung out with my son and put up christmas decorations i also got a ton of fantastic advise and support from you lovely folks thank you again tldr thank you for the support and kind words i am not mad at my friend just sad we could not meet up i followed social distancing rules when going out 2020 has sucked but personally so has the past decade or so
1,this shadowed figure he follows me everywhere i do not know if its a friend or a foe but he is making my life a messhe will not leave me alone since birth i have seen thisfigure it was as young as me and the more years i lived the bigger it became and the more it learned it was a black and grey figure bright grey eyes its arms thin with sharp claws and missing legs that had purple mist grow from where they should have been it appeared more frequently every passing day i told people about it but nobody wished to believe me when i told people they responded with well does this thing have a name if its so real it must have one sadly i did not know its name but one day i built the courage to ask it i met it in a forest by my house in private i asked for its name and why it was always following me he came close to me and spoke to me i go by many names sadness despair depression but in your case call meautism autism said he was connected to me since birth an accidental life back then i thought he was just a person nobody understood like me so i let him stay with me but now autism has almost ruined my life he began forcing me to be different separating me from people i cared about and those who cared for me i did not believe i could save myself from him he always held me close trapped me in strings with hooks that dug into my bones he used them whenever he wished and made me a puppet whenever he took me over i became aggressive harmful dangerous i always begged him to leave me alone but he just laughed and reminded me that we were stuck together one day i had had enough i finally faced the shadow that took me over and i reconciled with it i knew it would not leave even if i told it to i asked for it to try and change to listen to me to help me become unique to help me be normal not a monster to make me a person he stared back at me and apologized to everything he had done he had just wanted me to act his way we spoke until we finally reached an agreement i had thought my life was turning around i was making friends becoming active succeeding in school although he would return to his habits sometimes he kept his word and had become a friend of my own when i introduced people to him some were not impressed but most liked him and thought he was interesting it was working outuntil now i had believed 2020 would be the worst year of my life because of the events the world is facing but it ended up being the following year 2021 my mother had not been in the greatest of conditions she was stuck in the hospital due to a mass in her stomach and fluids filling her insides she was getting better every day to a point where we could take her back home she stayed on a hospital bed at the house though i was going to high school one day when my step dad told me he had the virus we lived about 6 streets away from out grandparents so me and my brother went to live with them until he got better taking care of my mother who was still at the house my grandparents told me we were going back to check on them autism was really nervous about what would happen but i ignored him we got there and we said hello to them then our stepdad told us the worst news ever our mom would pass away in the next two days to a week i was fully aware this was an opportunity to happen i was already prepared for this my brother was not as much so today was the day we would say goodbye to her i will not go into much detail about here but when we left back to our grandparents house i went upstairs and saw autism sitting on the bed sad i tried to comfort him every time i was about to cry he would tell me crying will not help its hard to keep the sadness in but do not she would tears for anybody in front of anybody it will only make it worse these events on my mom have happened a few days ago and is about to pass away i will also state that i am 14 years old and is confessing this here because i need helpi do not know if i should listen to him or not i really want to let all my emotions out but i cannotnot with him around
1,sometimes i wonder why i try this will probably be a little different from the usual posts here but the result is the same i just find myself wondering why i fight at this point i feel like i am surrounded by idiots that sounds conceited but i do not care anymore i try to reach a common viewpoint understand theirs and them understand mine but in the end it is pointless you know i argued with a guy today who told me capitalism is bad because under capitalism the people are exploited by businesses he has prior to this told me how he does not pay bus fair because no one enforces it i brought this up to him and he of course simply ignored it meanwhile i feel like socially i am just spinning my wheels i feel like i am never truly improving i am 26 and still have yet to really experience any kind of romantic relationship i am more inclined to talk about myself not out of narcissism necessarily but rather because it is all i can think to do to relate to people i am a bit full of myself but i have earned that i am smart and i save lives i do it as a volunteer and i will be further saving lives in nursing to that end i am surrounded by idiots at college not the normal idiots the professors i had a stat professor once give me the wrong explanation of probability fractions he said that to find the probability of at least 1 i would use the formula 1p1 1 minus the probability of 1 this is wrong i brought this to another professor of stat she gave me the write answer this man proceeded to explain to me in depth on the opposite side of this index card with the right answer why that was wrong during the test the answers were right but another question we all got right but were graded as getting it wrong we spent 30 minutes arguing for the right grade all this frustration and i fail out of nursing program on the second to last semester the dean was teaching though someone else was lecturing the dean however wrote the tests i am 26 now i know given the time of day i would pass with flying colors and make an excellent nurse however i am now having to finish this and restart of course who cares anyone i tell that to will just tell me i am not for the job never mind i discuss what i learned with doctors and nurses i know my shit not all of it but rather than teach they just blindly follow policy it is what it is you cannot fight the system so adapt that is always been how i operate but at this point i wonder why i even bother i loved my time in the hospital for clinicals and i want nothing more than to continue to work there but why fight to go back what is the point of living a life where i am always fighting uphill for the bits of joy i can get i cannot connect with anyone and when i do they ultimately stop talking to me even worse when someone is around i constantly think that i am just blind to how annoyed they are by me i am stuck between thinking i am smart and thinking i am an immature dolt i have spent years trying to work through all this but i am left wondering what it is all for what is the payoff will there even be a payoff i keep thinking if i work hard enough the enjoyable parts will begin to outnumber the miserable ones do not get me wrong there are days that are fun and those are great but it seems like i have to fight to get to them only to get knocked back is this all life is does it ever get to a point where i can enjoy more than i loathe i probably feel this way because i am depressed it is not 247 but i understand there is some kind of depression colloquially called walking depression who knows i will not get diagnosed i do not need a doctor to sit here and tell me what i already know heshe will outline treatment of course ssris tricyclics moais hell i would probably feel better but i can do this on my own i have made it this far i just wish i could get assurance that i am not wasting my time if this is as good as it gets i might as well kill myself now i could at least die remotely happy knowing every weekend has been a new adventure i died in my prime and i did not spend decades fighting for an unattainable goal
1,i got accused of plagiarism at university for a maths assignment last week i received an email about plagiarism on my last maths assignment it was an online subject that required students to check in online and view the tutors online whiteboard each student is signed in with their student number that at first caused me to have an anxiety attack at work but later on got over it because i came to my senses that this was causing me unnecessary stress when i did not plagiarise the email required me to have an interview with three people tutor unit coordinator and an observer but i am not obliged to go but i did anyways the email notified me to bring the person i plagiarised off from but the thing is i actually do not know anyone let a lone plagiarised off someone i did call them up and said i did have a friend to guide me with my maths assignment who does not do the subject at all basically does a different course completely same uni but different campus so fast forward to the date of the interview i was pretty confident of clearing my innocent i brought my friend in and they asked the guy next to be was the other plagiariser while exposing their name i blurted out who is that by accident so during the interview they brought out my assignment and the other persons only one question consisting abc were exactly the same how uncanny the thing is that was only like 10 of the assignment i do understand their point of view out of a few hundred students me and this person had the exact same answers so some of the answers were wrong but the plagiarised section they were asking me how i got the working out for these questions my dumbass really did guess it but i was able to explain how i got it the coordinators face was literally like this dumb bitch got an easy question wrong and plagiarised it but my explanation that literally disregarded it and just said how did you manage to plagiarise i did say i got them off the lecture notes but i really have no idea how i have the same answers as the other person anyways during the interview they were trying to throw my friend and i under the bus to admit to at least cheating which we did not all assessment at uni requires a signature to agreeing that all works is done by yourself only they were trying to imply i was cheating because my friend with me looked over my assessment questions they were trying to get him to agree basically that he did my assignment questions thank god he kept saying i only guided her with example questions just like the assignment you have given him which he actually did only guided me because i am trash at maths they said if you did get a tutor for this assignment that is cheating and that is a misconduct as it is not your own work but seriously what the hell i actually do not know anyone in this subject because it is all online lol i barely attended the online lectures it is summer break after all after the interview they are just telling me to think about who i plagiarised off from so this is just implying i am already screwed because i have to see the dean if he will dismiss this matter there are two guidelines i have to follow which is regardless brutal if i did plagiarise record fines etc and if i did not if i did not i am still not off the hook basically this is stressing me out badly for no reason i cannot prove my innocence when i walked outside the room i think the person who i apparently plagiarised was there i have never seen them before in my life i am just causing shitty outcome scenarios in my head like what if the person said i did but i did not they school just wants to hear the answer they want to hear i cannot prove my innocence how can they prove my plagiarism the unit coordinator is the one who reported this but said he cannot clear it the dean has to i just have to wait for a dreading email what to do and more interviews i have two final exams left for summer and i just cannot clear my head for this unnecessary problem one of the the exams is this subject i need to study
1,the catfish lover returns me again the catfish lover that piece of trash that cannot seem to find anyone in his life that is willing to talk to him let alone date himexcept for his catfish it is time for my weekly wishiweredead rant if you can call it a rant what is it called when a depressed person just goes on and on about being depressed it is not really a ranta rant would imply some level of anger i guess there is some angermaybe it is a rant anyways i just type whatever comes to my mind in these posts i really do not know how else to get out what i am trying to say if i do not just type what i am thinking i feel like i am censoring myself by having to reallocate my thoughts to a more sensible form i do not know i fucking hate my life that is all i know i am still talking to my catfish my wonderful catfish i cannot stop i cannot put her down it is a never ending cycle i have here well unless she ends it which i am terrified ofbecause that can literally happen at any second should she choose it which is stupidbecause i feel like i am walking on pins and needles trying not to piss her off i feel like i cannot really say what i want but at the same time i have no one else that will listen to me talk i could post these stupid messages every daybut it is not the same the need for human connection is incredibly real and a driving force in my depression i do not know what else to do i wish i could hire my therapist to just talk to me every day why does it have to be so god damned expensive to want to be happy why does it have to be so expensive to want to be like every one else fucking america fuck you capitalism i just want to be normal i just want to be happy i would give up anything and everything in my life to be happy literally drop of a hat if i could be guaranteed happiness at the exchange for everything i own or have i would do it no questions asked the only exception i would say are my dogs i love my dogs and would not give them up for the world they are as much a part of me as i am and they come with me wherever i go but being broke the rest of my life and living in shambles ok as long as i am happy but it does not matter the world does not work like that the world works like fucking fuck all and will fuck you in the ass whenever it gets the chance what the hell is the point of even trying i have said it before i could spend the next 10 years on dating apps and i would still get no where i would still end up dying alone and miserable because that is just who i am i am just one big worthless pile of shit that everyone hates how else could i have literally no matches for months i will never have a girlfriend again i will never have kids i will never get to see grandkids i am going to die alone if my parents were dead i probably would have killed myself by now but at this pointi think when my dogs die i will just go with them i will have no reason to live anymore after that and i am not sure i can handle them dying in the first place the thought of my oldest dog dying still mortifies me why do dogs only get a meager 1015 years how fair is that once againfuck you life these beautiful creatures these poor dogs one thing that is always scared me is death the absoluteness of it all what happens when we die do we justcease to exist do we reincarnate i do not know and that fucking terrifies me i am terrified of the nothingness i am terrified that life is pointless and has no meaning arguably that terror is the reason i am still alive today though i gave up religion long ago it never made sense to me and was just seemingly so illogical though i still occasionally pray to a god that might exist i guess that means i am agnostic i just do not want there to be nothing i do not want the 10 years i have with my dogs to be the only 10 years i have with them i do not want it to be their only years they deserve better than me if they only get that i am such a pile of shit
1,can stress utterly cripple my health and is there a way to fix that shot in the dark here and if this is the wrong subreddit let me know i slept 2 hours tonight because my anxiety is ruining me right now trying to keep it short so here goes i have been sick on and off since november it is majorly sinus infections that just will not go away i believe that my allergies because some inflammation episode but i am starting to wonder if the stress does it too november is thanksgiving i am allergic to furry animals not in the way where i could drop dead i mostly get headaches itchy and stuffy nose and i have to visit my family for holidays problem is they have several pets cats and dogs that are not necessarily wellgroomed their fur is matted and greasy and if i pet them because i am stupid and cannot help myself also animals soothe me in moments of stress the gunk gets stuck on my hands and it sticks to anything i touch i drank bottled water and hours later when i took a sip from the same bottle i could smell it family stresses me out they are too toxic to me but i feel obligated to go last year i had an anxiety attack prior to christmas because of how badly i do not want to go and i had just recovered from my first episode of sinus infections despite taking allegra twice prior so christmas came yet another stressful event and back to sinus infections after then i got really sick could not move for an entire day because everything was sore i could not even talk because those muscles hurt but finally recovered a few days of stuffy nose which is an improvement mind you and i wake up feeling like my face was punched eventually figure out it is my sinuses and it was not my husband accidentally suckerpunching me in the middle of the night first one side hurts then both nose gets stuffy cannot touch or move my nose in any way because of the pain it took a while but it went away recently yes recently it is february and i have essentially been sick nonstop since thanksgiving now the kicker is that today is a family members birthday and i plan on calling her too far for a visit but i could not sleep from anxiety other family also invited themselves over for my birthday and i get snarky remarks when i tell them i am busy which i truly am and they should know this i will not be meeting them yet but i will eventually or else i will not get to hear the end of it i felt off yesterday i barely had a few days of feeling normalish which still means a stuffy nose but today i just feel flat out sick like i am going to develop a cold throat feels coated i keep sniffling sinuses feel swollen and i am nauseous just last year i thought i could pride myself with a decent immune system because the last time i remembered getting sick was for a few weeks thanksgiving and xmas again duh it did not last months like it does this time now it is like there is a queue of health problems that my body checks off one after another so everyone gets their turn what would you guys recommend for me to do how can i manage this stress or at least avoid getting sick my stress levels are pretty bearable but being sick for so long is taking a toll on me and it is starting to kick me into some serious depression i feel the life draining out of me and with family knocking on my door in the near future my mind is just going in circles about how to even survive all this though part of me does not even want to anymore it sucks is my immune system suddenly retarded is it just my allergies that caused almost 4 months of inflammationsickness now or could it be that it is all the stress doing it i do get more and more stressed about holidays with every year i did not have anxiety attacks until last christmas before that it was just crying and needing my husband to calm me down somehow with lots of effort i am at a loss and i am even more stressed today between not having slept over this birthday call and feeling sick again
1,chronic stressanxiety and the aftermath of its related issues so long story short on the outside i have the seemingly perfect life 31yo female with no remarkable health issues a thriving career making a decent living a happy and healthy young daughter in a long term relationship with a man who loves me my daughters father a beautiful home nice car no real financial troubles aside from overspendingundersaving however i have been dealing with major chronic stressanxiety for about a year now stemming mostly from my relationship 75 stepchildren related and now my job because i am unable to resolve this stress i have always had anxiety issues so i have been an evening marijuana user for approx 8 years to wind down and help me sleep this stress has recently turned into depression 9 months ago when my stepdaughter was alienated from us because of me it was then i started to notice new troubling acute and intermittent symptoms like brain fog poor concentration no libido inability to relay thoughts consistently and effectively extreme fatigue no appetite no strength high bpracing heart weakness to name a few 4 days ago i experienced what i believed to be a mini stroke although i was alert i felt very disoriented could not talk normally felt confused off balance numbness in hands felt like i was gliding rather than walking after a couple of hours i eventually went to urgent care to get my symptoms reviewed as i simply just did not want to commit myself to ed if it was not 100 necessary i know that was not the best option in that moment however i felt for me it was neuro exam review was fine they said and she said i likely had an inner ear infection and gave me antivert and said to follow up with pcp me knowing my history i was not sold on that diagnosis but felt fine enough to accept it today i followed up with my pcp whom i have been with for 10 years she agreed that it likely was not an inner ear infection due to lack of symptoms so i have an mri ordered and will be going tomorrow i actually work in the medical field specifically mental health and addiction so i am very well aware that my stressanxietydepressionmj use are likely the reason for my issues i am concerned about the damage my body has endured with this strokelike incident has this stress simply turned my otherwise healthy body over for good i know without a doubt all of these issues have put me where i am today a few weeks ago prior to the stroke incident i was certain i had ms due to all my progressive symptoms yet knowing deep down the real most likely culprits that would need to cease before going to major diagnosis like that but the only missing symptom was a stroke then bam that happens i have not used mj for 4 days i am fine without it but the relationship and kid stress is something that will not stop or go away basically i have decided to finally move out to get away from the stress i cannot control and i am hoping that will save my life work related stress i used to handle like a champ but now i am falling behind at work and unable to catch up if things keep going this way i will eventually lose my job or worse my life as this constant fight or flight is slowly killing me my mood is just emotionless at this point i am simply in survival mode which has essentially ruinedended my relationship i realize i must make some major lifestyle changes i am just hoping to hear that these issues are resolvable assuming i make the right decisions i also am well aware that chronic mj use plays the biggest part in my mental health conditions however i had used that to cope with them up until now when i physically just cannot do that anymore anyone have anything to say not even sure what i am looking for here other than someone who has experienced this and understands what i am going through
1,nothin outta the ordinary paradise job stress life stress f bombs call me hand mediumlight skin tone beyond this point read on um hello well many can relate i am sure after today i am convinced i am a misanthrope kind of ironic because here i go again trying to get support from others i am on my way to being a construction specialist really i am just an asskisser i am below everyone no one respects me because they think i am doing better than they are when really i respect everyone even though i know 100 they are doing a lot better than me one more loose screw right there i mean fuck me man i mean i am not getting paid that much i drive a company vehicle i work hard very very hard i am being micromanaged i am in charge of a lot of people and projects but as far as worki think we kind of get in the way of trades doing the actual work i hate this business i am sure i amadd but nobody cares it is still my fault i mess up people are like crabs in a bucket i just told the painter to fuck off i told an old guy in the parking lot to fuck off recently i have moved states been 8 months i cannot or do not get a new state license so i can actually move forward i work too much my car is in need of repair i bought a motorcycle which i cannot ride legally i am living in a house that is not mine i am staying in a nice place with an awesome view by myself house sitting and paying them a decent amount of rent while the owners are outta townthat is about to end in a few weeks hard to keep up social life is super super lacking and dull of course first time moving away on my own sucks when everyone is telling me what to do and i do it there is a lot going on exact words to the painter who was complaining about my handy work since it is not my jobnot my specialty which i blatantly spelled out to themis ironic considering my soon to be former position the exact words were quite franklyi do not give a fuck i am this close to and i just shook my head and he understood right away either i was having a mental breakdown burnt out or that he needed to shut his trap before i shoved that paintbrush where the sun do not shine as for the old man i was driving with expired plates because i had to do some side work on the weekend and i could not drive my work truck because it has a company logo so i cannot even flip people off anymore i explained this to the guy been working 60 hour weeks none stop happened to have work i could not refuse right on the weekend so i had to risk going out again with this vehicle i have been pissed off at retirees lately since i have done a lotta work for them in this nice area i usually have respect but i get fed up with sucking up to people that act like toddlers once he took out his phone to take a pic of my license plate i got out and asked if he was retired he said yeah i am and looked him in the eye and said then fuck off go find something better to do he eventually left saying have a good day but i am just so fuckin done with people and myself and the world i just do not know how this is going to go it is an ever narrowing tunnel for all of us i mean to add to it i lostspent all my savings so far not much but very much needed at this point 2 grand and then some on fuckin online dating and scammers and complete incompetencedesperation on my part so yeah do not know what to do or where to gooptions are endless but i keep thinking a giant meteor would simplify that quite nicely do not you do not expect anyone to actually read this all the way through or even give a shit or what i expect you to type hopefully someone relates or even chuckles like yeah that is me i do not care i just got to know someone else will read this and potentially understand than just let this sit and stew inside me i am just venting so say hello internet i am about to fucking lose it
1,i am very stressed and i know why but what can i do about it please help me i am a 21 year old man right now i have summer break but i still feel as if i am always working 247 i never enjoy anything in life i am also depressed and i have many mental issues and i am always tired and unmotivated about everything and every single day feels as a heavy work day even if i am at home having free time there are 2 reasons of my high stress reason 1 is being an unhappy single and reason 2 is trying so hard to find someone which costs alot of effort and time before you read this i am not here for dating advice so please do not unless you have a magic trick that will 100 sure work for me since 4 years ago when i was 17 i started developing interest in girls now 21 i still never had a relationship but even worse i never had a date or even a female friend even though i have tried different strategies which i failed i never hugged a girl either i have exactly 0 experience with girls why am i so stressed it is because those 4 years first of all being single makes me unhappy and second i have been trying very hard to find a girl to get the first date in my life or to even make a female friend every single day i waste my time on dating i mean endless swiping apps read neverending swiping but never getting a match asking on reddit how to get a girlfriend asking google how to get a girlfriend thinking about being single forever you know what i mean i waste alot of my time and energy in doing research about how to find a girlfriend but trust me i have really tried going outside and trying out dating apps i really tried stuff too nothing works so how can i feel less stressed 1 find the love of my life and be happy but this will not happen any time soon it seems impossible so what can i do to get my mind off the impossible i really have hobbies and interests i have a life so that is not the problem here the only missing part in my happiness is having a girlfriend i feel very frustrated and tired and stressed and i am starting to hate life seeing guys getting girlfriends as if it is the easiest thing in the world just makes me angry these days even 10 year old kids have relationships i guess my purpose on earth is just to be a loser i am so obsessed with dating and trying everything that i have no more focus on anything else in my life i do not care about family anymore i do not care about my friends anymore i do not care about my hobbies anymore i do not care about study anymore i do not care about anything except i just want a girlfriend how can i be happy without having a partner really i have study i have a great family i have friends i have a hobby my life is fine except for being girlfrienddeprived which really bothers me alot it seems impossible to focus on anything else than how to get a girlfriend is there anything i can do to feel more happy and relaxed and stop hating life whenever i play videogames or do whatever to relax and try to enjoy it does not really make me happy because my frustration of being single and fear or being single forever stays in the background of my thoughts no matter what i am doing or focusing on and whenever i try to relax or study or do anything i feel guilty towards my dating life thinking if i do not take action i will never find a partner what should i do to feel happy and not frustrated and stressed am i asking for the impossible here because honestly i thikn there is no way i can be happy without a partner i just have this desire and it is really strong and it is growing stronger i cannot just remove my desire can i edit please do not tell me to get therapy or medication i already tried that and just no therapy would also take even more of my time and energy which i do not have this year
1,time for another round of do i actually feel sick or is it just psychosomatic i generally feel unconcerned with the coronavirus thing if you think you have it quarantine yourself stay clean but if you get it it is not the end of the world assuming you are healthy and have no preexisting conditions just rest and get better i tend to have little issues related to things other than illness aches and pains from my job nausea that happens for no real reason from time to time anxiety from depression and stress etc and i would like to think that if this whole virus thing with inconsistent symptoms it seems health sites say one thing individual people say well actually was not happening i would not be stressing over what ifs as much are these little it is nothings actually something is what i have been wondering more for example i am not constantly sneezing or have a runny nose like a cold but i have been sneezing just a bit more often my throat is not sore though it does get itchy or scratchy out of nowhere and if i cough it is to relieve the feeling in my throat not a cough that comes from the lungs if that makes sense so allergies right but i have also been getting chest pain and having more issues breathing not constantly just out of nowhere it will start and stop at some point ok chest pain could be stress andor anxiety because i have a lot of that in my life oh and i have also been getting headaches lately which is not normal for me but i had been chalking it up to stress since it came before everything else my mom was away for a week and a half visiting a friend and i basically had to pick up some responsibilities like going to the store driving people places making sure regular things were done like the garbage being taken out all things that sound easy but are stressful and frustrating when it feels like you are the only one doing it so stress causing the chest pain and headaches and i figured that allergies could be causing the trouble breathing it is happened before usually in the spring i am not sure what i am allergic to but it is definitely something in the air during the warmer weather and it has been starting to get warmer plus as far as i know i have not had a fever i have been getting the chills lately but that is also common when i am overtired which can be from stress but then there is the doubts especially after i hear that the symptoms are not definitely this this and this like one of the things emphasized is the difficulty breathing but i have seen a post from one confirmed case that said they only had that symptom when they tried to smoke so under certain circumstances i also thought you had to have coldlike symptoms but apparently not this virus is one that you apparently need a bingo chart to mark your symptoms and so i am just conflicted am i just plagued by stress causing me to have mild explainedaway symptoms or is there a chance that it is really something i am not worried about dying if i do have it i ordered some pure vitamin c though at the behest of my one sister very holistic linked me to a site where i can get it without anything else added in revitalizewellnessorg if anyone is interested she says it treats it or something and gave me a dosage chart i am just very tired of this whole situation i guess my other sister is pretty convinced she has it and has stayed home from work the last 2 days she said she does not feel well and while i am not sure that hers is not also mental since she is been freaking out since the start not my life woman_shrugging_light_skin_tone and since i am in regular contact with her because we live in the same house well it also adds to that what if mentality what if anyone else feel similar or am i just crazy and overly stressed
1,i feel like my mental health professionals do not care but i cannot tell if that is the depression talking hi i am sorry if this is the wrong sub for this question i do not normally like to discuss my mental health problems because i think that makes my problems feel worse but i need some outside judgement here i will keep this as quick as possible but i am afraid it is still going to be a little long i am in a partially hospitalized mental health program which means that i go to a hospital 6 hours a day 5 days a week i see psychiatrists and therapists there but i fill my own prescriptions at my local pharmacy i have been in this program 3 weeks with 1 to go at the beginning of the program the psychiatrist wanted to adjust the dose of one of my medicines instead of just ordering a prescription for pills at the new dose she decided to order 30 pills which were each about a third of the new dose so that i could take a little more or less as she thought appropriate from the beginning she told me to take 3day i took 3day so the 30 pills only lasted 10 days i had to really bug my therapist to get a new appointment with the psychiatrist after that 10 days was up even though this medicine is one of the ones you cannot just stop taking safely finally i got to see her 13 days from when she wrote the original prescription which was this last friday when i went to fill the new prescription at about 4 that afternoon the pharmacy tech told me that my insurance would not cover the new pills because my psychiatrist had written one a day on the original prescription he said he could give me the pills but i would have to pay the full sticker price of 780 instead of my nice co pay 0 i stayed calm because i thought this was just a stupid mistake and called my psychiatrist who nonchalantly told me that the pharmacy tech was wrong and that i should just be more assertive about filling the prescription if that did not work she said i could try good rx i tried good rx and only got 40 off i called back this time panicking a bit at exactly 4 17 pm the secretary informed me that the psychiatrist had just walked out but offered to refer me to my therapist my therapist was kind but said something which boiled down to friday at 4 is almost friday at 5 and no one here is going to be able to help you on friday at 5 i ended up coming back the next day and with the help of good rx and the incredibly kind pharmacy tech getting the pills for 113 i just want to know is the programs response or lack thereof normal are most mental health professionals this laid back about seemingly urgent stuff or do mine really just not care i have only had 1 other psychiatrist and she is awesome i plan on returning to her after this program so i know she would never do this the depressed hopeless voice in the back of my brain is telling me that these people really do not give a fuck and that i should just give up and not return for my last week whether or not that is a reasonable conclusion how can i push myself to go back to the program despite feeling hurt and confused by this thanks in advance for your help edit i just realized while taking my abilify that she wrote 12 tablet daily on the prescription of 30 tablets i was only supposed to take 12 of a tablet for the first 6 days after that she told me to take 1 tablet a day does this mean my insurance will not cover a refill of the abilify until 60 days have passed this is more rhetorical because i think i know the answer i know i am really lucky in a way because my financial position is safe enough that this is not a huge issue but i want to scream at these people the pharmacy tech said this is basic prescriber knowledge and i am pretty certain he was not wrong
1,i honestly cannot tell if i am depressed or lazy as shit hi everyone using a throwaway to avoid identification as i 19f write this i am on the verge of tears and have a lump in my throat for no discernible reason before this i spent the whole day lying in the same spot watching tv save for the one time i got up to make myself instant noodles at dinner i started tearing up because i was disappointed with the food this is kind of embarrassing my mum keeps asking me why i am always lying down not in a malicious way or anything and i cannot really pinpoint the reason but i am always unexplainably exhausted the good days are fine and sometimes really good but the bad days like today just really suck i feel like i am suspended in time and everything is in slow motion i have wasted yet another day for some context i am in a transitional period in my life graduated from high school waiting to start college in october i have had some moments of euphoria here and there that made me feel at the top of the world got accepted to some really good schools etc however for the most part nothing really excites me this is a real low compared to my last 2 years of high school consistent high achiever top student for a bunch of subjects you get the gist during which i felt some degree of fulfilment because i kept getting told i was good at things i notice that when i am not occupied by the hustle and bustle of school i always get like this more intensely than otherwise like during summer vacations another thing every single friend of mine has been motivated enough to get a job and do stuff that excites them i have barely done anything the only 2 things i managed to bring myself to do in the last 3 months were the result of me being talked into them by various people i am a major pushover so obviously i ended up doing them i just cannot bring myself to apply for a part time job because everyday i just go i am tired and i will do it another day i feel like shit because i do not know if i have a problem or if my problem is just that i am lazy my head is really heavy as i write this so i apologize for my streamofconsciousness writing style the reason why i am so confused is that when i am in social settings i am really lively and fun i am also a very typical gifted kid overachiever with much less to worry about that my friends who are on the edges of their seats trying to figure out what to do in the future and shit i have a loving family and supportive friends i am grateful for everything i have but i just get extremely blue and temperamental for no reason sometimes i do not dare to discuss this with anyone i know because nobody would expect this from me i do not know if this information helps but i typically feel like this during long holidays basically if people are not giving me responsibilities i cannot bring myself to do anything i am so sorry i do not have the ability to organise this coherently right now but could anyone share what depression can feel like or at least give me a reality check if i really am just lazy and melodramatic some clarity would be amazing please be as candid as possible because if it really just is an attitude problem at least i can stop being selfpitying and start doing something about it just a disclaimer i have never seriously considered suicide but from time to time i wonder what it would be like to just disappear do not worry about me being a danger to myself because i would never do it that was a really long post if you read to the end thank you edit i will be deleting this account soon but before that thank you everyone for the kind words advice and suggestions it means the world to me and i am going to try to act on your advice 3 take care of yourselves
1,i am forced to move home into a 1person rental for the first time and my employer throwing us through an organisational restructure at the same time the stress is colossal and i do not think i will find a way out of all this alive what can i do to manage all the stress so the stress i am trying to manage is quite the beast i have put it in dot points to help separate each stressor but it is still a mess so sorry in advance work has been putting us through a restructure since july 2020 my job does not exist in the new structure and i am genuinely terrified that i lack the skillsets to do any of the jobs even in a learning capacity i have applied for a few jobs in the new structure to further my career but i have failed to get a single interview to date i am terrified about looking outside my current employer as i would have to start all over again my skillset has unfortunately only become relevant to the employer i am with i graduated a bachelor in information technology in 2016 but it is been so long since then that i have actually forgotten most of the programming stuff i did and starting again will put me back into the suicide mentality i think i am really shit at it but it is all i have and i do not want to go through the additional stress of reskilling or going back to a shitty retail job that will just make me hang myself in 6 months taking an entrylevel job at work also is not an option as there is no career progression here unless you basically do someone elses job because they are too shit to do it themselves that is how i got into my current job and i absolutely do not want to go back to answering the phones again backwards is not an option the last batch of jobs in the new structure came out yesterday and finish in 2 weeks applying for these takes about 56 hours each as they want you to write a billion fucking things as part of the application and each jobs application requirements are different from the last i had to move out my situation with flatmates was a risk to my health and immediate safety so i need to jump ship as soon as possible due to covid19 noone is moving 01 of homes in my city and surrounding cities available to rent this month as opposed to 10 this time last year meaning every place i inspected had over 30 people apply for them i never heard back regarding my applications fortunately my cousins friend bought a place and desperately needs someone to fill it the rent is higher than what i was looking for by about 100week but due to covid19 the rental market is fucked right now and has driven the rent prices up everywhere in my state in my country he offered me the place but it is unfurnished so i need to purchase all the furniture and appliances and organise all the amenities due to my job instability i literally do not know if i can afford anything should i find myself unemployed and burning money to keep myself afloat i did not want to be in a position where i have to move home and find a new job simultaneously i simply do not have the mental capacity to handle both of these all on my own even with the help my psychologist provides and friends doing their best to help me out where they can i am genuinely terrified that it is all going to be too much and i will kill myself very soon or later this year if this stress goes on for too long any tips on managing this fucking nightmare my life is right now edit while my employer could not pick a worse time to choose to restructure they have got a contract with a career support service that has helped with resume sculpting and interview preparation but i feel super inadequate and a bit of a lost because edit 2 my dog of 13 years died this morning so the last 6 months can fuck off and then fuck off again
1,i have been making notes to people as a final goodbye i do not know if i should be doing this or not but for the one person i loved i have been writing a letter like a apology and if i am going to be dead i can send it to them i have not done it for anyone else because i do not have anyone else i want to say sorry to and let them know my final thoughts about them i have ended you making her dislike me a little and i feel like making her dislike me so if i am gone she would not feel sad about me for the final gifts i plan on gibbing i got her this special necklace and i just hope she wears it one time the next time i see her so i can see her beautiful smile while wearing the necklace i got her for the first time then i feel like i can go without worry this is the note for anyone curious in reading it but every day i write more and more into this because i am trying to make the best goodbye letter can i confess something right now i am really scared and sad and hating everything i really feel worthless and i hate the fact that i have the shit in my head it makes me feel like a burden to other people recently though i do not know why but you keep popping up in this dream and it is the same one over and over it is of you and me and we are cuddling i am all happy then it is just you by yourself while i slowly sink into a pitch blackness as i struggle to get to you but you do not notice me drowning slowly in the darkness and you move on and live your life while i am stuck in that darkness slowly drowning and then i woke up in a panic attack i do not mean to put stress on you i may never send this but even if i am gone and stuck in the darkness it made me feel as though i am already gone to you and i am just a thing of the past maybe i already am i do not understand why i am like this i hate it but every time i get that dream i can only think that it means that i am going to be gone for good and that i am no longer important to the only person i have ever loved if this is sent it is after i give you the presents and after that i plan to be gone completely you will not ever have to hear from me again and you can live the happy life i know you will have this is hard to write because i do not know how you will feel towards me being gone for good i have been trying my best to be helpful to you and trying to make you smile and feel better when i am gone though i hope that you are able to be happy and that you take care of the things that are special to me that i gave you this is already long enough i do not even know if you will read all of this through but if you did i loved you and you brought me almost all of my happy memories i do not know if you think i was a bad boyfriend or not and that most of our relationship was bad because it was not it was the funniest and the best thing in my life and i hope that you can remember me with the good memories of us when i am gone especially the ice skating one that is the most special memory i have of us besides when we first became a couple and our first kiss well if i am still here after i sent this text then i am sorry i always wished i could have married you and started a family with you but lifes not fair so thank you for the good memories and showing me the happiness that i thought i would never had i know you regret a lot of things with me and i hope by the time i send this that we would have made amends and you forgave me if not then at least me being gone will be easier for you to move on and not feel bad or guilty when you think about me i hope you care for the gifts because they will be the last things you get from me i do not know if i will send this maybe before a hangout with everyone or maybe after so i could hangout with you one last time and see your smiling face

1,almost beat that shit advices hi to all my soldiers this is my first post on this media and i want to share you my shitty last 8 months since the start of 2021 by the way of life on november 2020 i have been diagnosed with a dep because my life fucked up as a student courses were annoying af finding an internship was terribly hard i argued a lot with my friends and i lived alone in my small flat what a beautiful life i first did not consult a specialist because i thought it was useless big mistake so i dig down more and more on february 2021 i felt terribly bad and my meds did not help much so i went to emergencies because i wanted to die nothing was worth to stay alive i have been admitted to a psychiatry center for 1week it was cool but i fell again when i came back this time i knew i wanted to fight my family and friends were not worthy not helping at all everything in my life was flavorless but i think we do not precisely search to die we want to live in a different way the 56 following months were terrible i live in a countryside so i went to cry in a field 3 times a day i spent every single fucking day alone in my pain to feel better i decided to act on the cycle sleep nutrition exercise i messed up in all these aspects so i tried to sleep early and planned an alarm at 11am at first tried to force my body to eat at each meal and i tried to exercise a minimum walking running etc with time my body used to this and i reached a better health form this was not natural i needed to force myself every fucking days now 8 months later i am still alone at home i did not contact my school yet but i feel better i can cook i can exercise i can enjoy a book i can live by myself i even did a hike trip alone in my region during 1 week time is not hurting anymore i still feel lonely but it is a hard problem to solve i want to share you the key points that made a difference during my recovery visit a psychiatrist please and take the meds the role of this doc is not to help you he just asks you the right questions because you are your own doc and he wants you to do it by yourself let your phone off social media killed me a lot plus i wanted my friends to be helpful but they cannot you are friends cannot help you execpt if they lived this shit keep very close friends to your side maybe they cannot help but they can help you to live some neutral moments instead of suffering alone in your home i did not respect that point plan an activity to do cultural manual etc have a walk in a natural space several times a week even if it seems hard your brain need to breath fresh air buddy accept your feelings listen to your sadness and try to understand what it says keep a daily journal it helps a lot to exteriorize your feelings telling everything you think about you people life in general it helped me everyday during my hard time this is only my experience and you will probably do not relate to everything but please contact a specialist and take care of you the process is long you need to be patient but your life will be better afterwards depression is terrible it is like visiting a remote dark place alone while we are thousands and hundreds people here but depression will teach you many positive things once your mind will be clear to see the world you will be very enthusiastic to enjoy just a piece of chocolate compared to others because you know how it feels to not feel pleasure at all during several months or years i give you all my support and do not forget that you are not alone and people love you they do man love you all from my french country
1,my girlfriend died hey everybody i am writing this to vent about 5 years ago my girlfriend died she died on the night of june 13 2013 from a car accident there was a drunk driver swaying back and forth in the road she swerved to miss him and crashed into a tree in a ditch we met each other when we were 10 going on 11 years old back in 5th grade of course for a while we were just close friends but eventually it turned into more we met each other randomly i would say we just happened to be in the same class from 5th to 7th grade we hung out all the time mainly during school after 7th grade she moved a little ways away and started attending another school we still hung out with each other every weekend though i would say it was around this time we started actually dating each other fast forward to senior year of high school at this point we had been dating for some time both of us applied to the same university so that we could go together after graduating we wanted to go for film photography we loved each other very much we were honestly just right for each other we rarely ever argued with each other or got annoyed with each other we graduated from high school in may unfortunately right after high school she had to move about a state away for family reasons but then she was going to be back soon for college senior year and after graduating we hung out quite a bit when she left we would txt throughout the day and talk on the phone at night on the night before june 13th we talked on the phone about random stuff for a good hour she really hated living far away from me especially right after graduating on the 13th we did not txt each other all day because we were busy later in the day i waited until she was free so that we could talk on the phone i txted her around 7 but she did not respond i just assumed she was busy a little after 8 i received a phone call from her mom i was somewhat surprised she was calling me because although sometimes she would call it just seemed odd i cannot forget or even describe the pain in her voice it must have took her a few minutes to tell me what was even going on eventually she told me that my girlfriend had died i remember initially freezing up but i could feel tears running down my face the pain anxiety and guilt was massive that night i could not sleep at all the next night i slept maybe a few hours my life took a sharp turn when she died i was so much more lively and joyful i just became dull and lifeless i felt lifeless as well this is kind of random but i never grew my hair out growing up it was always buzzed short but when she died i kind of gave up and grew it out for 2 years my life spiraled out of control for about two years i became a nihilist i lost joy in life i do not want to go down that rabbit hole though fast forward to now i have really came a long ways since then i did not go to college right after high school i could not find the motivation to after about two years i got myself together and attended college though right now in my life i am almost about to graduate from college not in film photography but i think she would be proud of me i wanted to write this because most people in my life have no idea that i lost someone so important losing her was like losing half of my being lately i have been thinking of her wishing she was by my side as i graduate i wish she was here it feels good to write this though for about three years i had no desire in pursuing another girlfriend but lately i have felt the desire to do so i hope someday i find someone i can love as much as i loved her thanks for reading
1,feeling stressed and anxious about life and it really hurts i am a 19yearold girl a senior in college and my existential crisis is getting worse as a kid i have been traumatized by death i remember clearly the day i learned what it was i was maybe 4 or 5 years old in a museum my dad loves visiting them and i always hated going there because it was very silent and spacious giving me the feeling that i had swallowed a bowling ball with a million knots in my stomach the statues looked so real to me i thought they were real people staring at us one of the statues was very intriguing it was a woman on a bed being surrounded by angels i asked my mom what it meant she answered saying it is most likely she is dead and the angles help her ascend to heaven and of course i asked what is death and she said it is when you leave this world someday and you go to heaven or hell this freaked the hell out of me for so many years mom told me that no one knows when we will day it could happen anytime this made of fear the future this nothingness that is death is terrifying to me even heaven seem scary like i always imagine it as a boring white place with nothing going on i am more of agnostic very confused about everything i got into counseling to deal with the stress of the uncertain rather than my existential crisis it got better and try my hardest to be excited for the future because there is so much that i want to do and achieve but now it is coming back and making me feel like absolute shit because i am realizing that i am no longer a kid i am an adult being taken away from those days i really scared of dying absolutely terrified everything i do now seems meaningless the things i love like makeup and taking care of myself i always feel guilty if i waste my time being on the internet but then if i not doing that i would be reading a book and even that seems unnecessary i am afraid of turning old afraid of the future on top of that global warming is making life more anxious i do not want to live at a time where the world might end in such a terrifying way i am making my best to help the environment but many do not take that seriously i am also afraid of wasting my youth away i have strict parents so i do not get to go out with my friends do things alone and i have never experienced love i know women who are now in their late 30s stuck at their parents house being sad i do not want that i want to move out when i have a job live in another country but with parents like mine strict muslim household they will refuse and i am so scared of doing that that i will not be happy filled with guilt or that it would not work out plus my parents i really love them do not want to leave them but if i stay with them i will not be able to live my life to the fullest so i am in a dilemma i have to make a decision somehow because time is running and must not spend my time chickening out but i am in a dilemma my head is a mess i feel very hopeless miserable and anxious i feel very lonely would love to be hugged and loved my faculty happens to be only female i do not feel that connected to them and the only friends that i have are far from me one is on another continent and the other is not in my faculty very busy with work where i am is not great it is a country with many issues and i am the only foreigner in my uni the place is quite dangerous you cannot go anywhere without a car and we do not have that so i am stuck at home with my thoughts to fuck me all over i really miss europe that is where i grew up really hope to move out to somewhere great i just want to be free and happy
1,my bipolar mother is stopping me from getting vaccinated and i am losing my fucking mind i am going to fucking break something i swear to god i should also mention i am all sorts of mentally ill as well i do not know exactly what i have had so many diagnoses thrown at me major depressive disorder persistent depressive disorder bpd bipolar type 2 ptsd cptsd and a couple more so i really cannot make heads or tails of my own issues but suffice it to say i am not the most stable wellput together person either but i had to move back in with my mum recently because i was living in the middle of sydney working as a bartender when the delta wave hit here i lost my job and could not afford rent or anything had already sold most of my stuff to try cover it but eventually i had to give in and move i really did not want to live with her again she freaked out and kicked me out at the start of the first lockdown and it almost left me homeless did not even speak to her for a year after that but i buried the hatchet to go to her wedding anyway i ran outta options and now i live with her again but she is freaking out all over again she refuses to get vaccinated because she is convinced it will kill her but she also think that the second anyone leaves the house they will get covid and bring it back which will also kill her guess it does not really matter i have literally no friends and never leave the house anyway only used to go to work and the gym but works not an issue and gyms are closed anyway but i am literally not allowed to leave the house period cannot even go for a walk or sit in the sun or check the fucking mail i want to get vaccinated because i think it is the responsible thing to do right now and i would like to have the option to go to the post office or the chemist or maybe have face to face therapy sessions again at some point virtual therapy is awful for me there is nowhere i can go in my house where i will not be overheard and i am never alone so i cannot speak freely which kind of defeats the whole point of therapy and so i told her i was going to call up a medical centre nearby to get vaxxed tomorrow but she is not going to let me apparently she is convinced i will get the virus and bring it home from the medical centre i have tried telling her that is pretty unlikely and that now is the safest time because cases are only going to rise every day i wait and all this shit but it does not matter she will not listen to reason despite being 22 i never got my full license because she was always too scared to teach me and i could not afford enough lessons to get my hours that way so i could drive myself but legally i would need her in the car also it is her car so unless i steal her car and break the law potentially losing my licence in the process i literally cannot get it i feel like a fucking kid again like i am not being allowed to make my own choices it is infuriating she is also talking about moving somewhere super regional because it is too dangerous here and i do not know what the fuck i am going to do if she does that i am just stuck my hands are fucking tied my entire future at this point is bound to the decisions of someone who is quite literally delusional i have no one no one can help me i have no money i could not even afford my fucking meds this week had to come off them cold turkey so now i am also dealing with the most fucked up ssri withdrawals on top of all this shit i just want to fucking kill myself i really do not know what the fuck to do i am just trapped completely fucking trapped because i am too poor and alone to do anything about the walls closing in around me this is so fucked up
1,parentified parent with severe depression i am a 31 male and at this point id be glad if someone or something would take my life it all went rapidly downhill after i got my first child who is a wonderful little boy now so similarly vital and full of life and energy like i was when i was little everybody used to go jesus christ the energy on that boy i mean everybody now i feel dead for a long time and next to the current situation i feel even worse i was physically parentified by my father fulfilling his beliefs and standards and taking care of his needs when he was terminally ill with leukemia for 15 years he held me responsible for him and as a buffer between my brothers and my mother i am the eldest i was emotionally parentified by my mother who could not deal with the pain and anxiety of raising children so young and losing herself and doing that with a man with so many problems himself my father was violent distant controlling bullying etc constantly needing my emotional support since i was 6 i realized that this is fucked up when i was 27 and started to notice and address my problems after such an upbringing while being supportive of both of my brothers who ended up in suicidal depression for a while and in addition dealt with my mom who almost died and was in a coma for a while i had a few longterm relationships until now where i never wanted to move in with another person because i have never had enough personal space myself the relationship i am in now started 3years ago we moved in together and that led to suicidal depression at the end of the first year so i managed to crawl out somehow but to realize my adolescent years were all in a depressive haze and i never managed to truly find myself and be myself and fully enjoy life as a young person or as a child now after the baby i feel so alone so tired and so failed finally there is a family i would like to take care of because i want to this time its my own son and i love him so much but i have been stuck taking care of my otherfamily and now i am just so wasted mentally and physically if i am home i am anxious and do not have any personal space and nothing to do just for myself when i am at work i fucking hate everybody there because i did not have the time to get the hell out of there which is financially almost impossible now i loose connection with my mainly single friends who i despise now in a way and i fucking hate everybody else on the streets traffic and anyone who wants to interact with me with the kid i see my previous family a lot aswell which is so tiring i have a small rented room for myself for which i do not have any time to go to or if i am there i just cry and watch the clock to get back in time to deal with baby chores so i feel stuck in the same demonic mental state like with my previous family adding the love and responsibility for my child which makes it impossible to say grow up i am out of here my woman is in a similar burnout state so not much support from there its the oppisite i feel i should be the one to support her and i can see how devastating it is for her when i break down which causes in turn so much blame for myself all of which drains me of the little energy i have left so now i am in full suicidal mode again and not able to do any of these things mentioned and no time to do anything i known i need to do for myself to be sane which makes me think why bother at all anymore on top of that i am ill aswell atm so a total wreck i just needed to get it out i do not know if its the best sub for this but anybody else been there
1,i do not want to kill myself i just do not want to exist my life feels to be falling apart i do not know how to explain it other than my limbs all being stretched and physically unraveling and dislodging my brain is rot and my insides are rot rotted goop i do not have a purpose in life i have no dreams in life i am wasting away the prime of my life i dive into my eating disorder to cope and get high sometimes and selfharm therapy for me of 3 years failed and my therapist took an indefinite leave so that went down the drain my psychiatrist is cool but i have tried 15 meds and nothing really works i cannot figure out this big issue in my life and i repeatedly obsess and ruminate over it with no answers or solutions as i sit paralyzed in fear i think i just realized today that my depression has been getting worse in ways i did not recognize as i have gone up on this new medication talking to people has become more of a chore than it used to be it gets on my nerves to have to speak up or when anyone talks to me i do not care to talk about anything i am interested in anymore i used to at least have some interest in certain topics but now i just do not care and i do not want to talk to anyone every word said to me or that i say is a fork on a chalkboard i have to psych myself up to raise my voice and speak i do not care about doing things i used to do with friends well i care less anyway or more like i am just indifferent numbed out i still care but it does not feel asthere it feels like i am wearing emotioncanceling headphones it is all still there but it is so muted i cannot stay awake during the day at work at all worse now than before i find myself seeming to play less with my wonderful pets i have lost credibility at work and plateaued with my ability and i just do not care anymore it makes me feel bad but i do not care enough to do anything about it at all i realize i suck at my work but so what i have already failed i still fail so what my motivation was already shit but now it is more like i do not care i used to be upset that my motivation was gone angry about it in a sense and now i kind of just do not give a shit i recognize that my motivation is still gone and sure it is still upsetting but not as upsetting as it was because i do not feel the anger at myself as much occasionally i have bursts of extreme emotion like yesterday i had a major anger rage moment where i had to take anti anxiety meds to even remotely start to calm down after a period of screaming slamming things around and knocking things over and selfharming viciously in a frenzy some days i burst into tears for all night and just keep a rag with me to soak up the tears as the time passes and i try to do things that fall within my normal schedule and small range of activities i do once i go home from work every day is a repeat of the day before week by week all the same it is monday then suddenly friday then the weekend then mondayrepeat i do not care about any of it monday wednesday sundaywhatever all the same the best part of my day is when i get to come home from work and have a binge and purge episode for like 23 hours that is literally the most i look forward to and even that is starting to fade out everything is faded everything is muted at random times i explode but then the monotony sets back in and i find myself almost in a stupor of some kind my life is meaningless and i want it to be over i do not want to commit suicide i just want to not exist

1,journal for nobody probably sorry for this long and messy rant i just wanted to write this down and maybe someone might read it and share their thoughts about this with me i often feel alright but then i feel really blue i do not know i am just really pessimistic about the world itself and about me myself i do not know where to start sorry what is there to say about why i am sad about the state of the worldpretty obvious we are all on a way towards a dystopia and there is no way preventing iti always dreamt of a utopic future of a space society sort of thing i know it sounds stupid but i always wanted something like that like a feeling humanity is destined for greater than where we are going but we are not i also cannot bear the thought of living my life to work for 4050 years from now to get little highs in my freetime with me myself it isweird i feel depressed but i also feel like i am not depressed enough to get help even posting this feels kind of insulting to people here that feel way worse than me like i got basically almost everything to be happy so why am i not i simultaneously love and hate myself like i think i am a good person and stuff but i also hate my inconsequence onanything i wanted to quit smoking i got a vape i wanted to work out and get healthier then i waste away in my room playin games and watching the same stuff over and over to get comfortable in familiarity i want to play the guitar yet i do not practise at all because id rather play gamesi also want to get a partner again but i have left my dating app untouched since i installed it never even made a profile it is always the same shit tomorrow for sure and then i do not and if i manage to i stop after a few days it got even worse since i got busted for marihuana use half a year ago weed was always this kind of safe haven to me i could waste away without remorse and only felt depressed occasionally and then i would just smoke a head and thought of something else since i got busted i live basically the same life but without this weed distraction also now because the bust i got to fear my apprenticeship and feel like i have to prove something to my employers just to keep the privilege to work there anymore i cannot drive to work or to school anymore for at least the next half year and feel like i am an inconvenience to my parents cuz they need to drive me everywhere now even though they say it is no big deal and have generally been really supportive but i also do not want to tell them exactly how i feel because i feel like i would not deserve this extra worry from my parents as they have already did so much for me i have felt really bad this eve and i just wanted to cry but i could not i just feel shit but not like crying i just want the time back when i did not have to worry about this shit and even if i feel better tomorrow my motivation will not change and i will continue to waste awayi have thought about phoning our insurance to ask if they would cover some sort of therapy just to get advice but i am scared they will not i am also scared i just will not call because i do not feel like it again i just want to get away go on an adventure i would love for a drwho to land with a tardis in front of me and take me on a giant adventure into space and time away from work and responsibilities but still in reach of my parents and the people i love sorry for this long ass text if anyone even reads it i just needed to get this off my chest
1,stressburnout breakdown thanks to my job i am the introspective and analytic guy so sometimes i like to do my job alone without the interference of others and sometimes when i interact with people at the end of the day i feel exhausted i work in a digital agency for a little more than three years in the last year before became de leader of my team i have been the employee who worked a shift of 12 hours long but i loved of what i was doing taking care of 12 clients and my job was mostly hands on without so many meetings recently i became the coordinator of my team so i have to take care of 7 people plus over 50 clients and since the beginning of the year all i am doing now is doing meetings with current and new clients leaving my team aside i feel responsible for a lot of mistakes they have been doing since i cannot take a closer look at them because of all these meetings sometimes these meetings start at 9 am and end 9 pm one after another lunch in front of the pc was really common or not eating at all besides that i have been disliking the way the company is being managed since a new coo is in charge my worst breakdown came when i was talking with my new employee showing to him a few things about the company and seeing the messages in my whastapp skype and email coming up all at once feeling really overwhelmed when i finished speaking with this new employee i called to a fried of mine and started to cry a lot besides all that the corona virus situation makes me feel bad too i have been fearful that i contract this and let my parents sick too both 70 so i am really concerned with them while them do not believe in anything of what is happening for the past 30 days i am having a breakdown so working is being really difficult for these past days i am feeling restless heavy chest could not sleep or sleeping really late so i could enjoy more time away from work i woke a lot of times feeling down and wanting to cry crying really really easily questioning about my work and myself isolating myself easily forgetting any information walking up and down in my house with a blank mind feeling anxious i asked for a vacation so i could rest a little hoping that i could feel better i even disabled any notifications from my whatsapp so i could rest and do not think about them but i am in the last day of my vacation and cannot see an end to feeling this way i have been thinking about changing careers too so i do not have to speak with clients i tried to speak with the ceo and the coo about that but all they did was opening an excel table write down a few solutions none of them was good and asking for me for a solution there was no empathy to my feelings i do not know what this feeling is burnout maybe and i do not know what to do should i quit my job and rest for a while should i change my career to another one that i do not need to talk with clients is there any other way to handle this recently i started getting a psychological support but still this feeling does not go away ps sorry for my english it is not my first language tldr i am really introspective and i think because of my job as a team coordinator having to talk to a lot of clients going through a lot of stressful situations like averting cancellations it is making me feel really down about my work and myself lately and i do not know what to do or how make this feeling go away
1,something is wrong with me i really need help hi i need help there is something wrong with me and i do not know what it is but i need help please this will be a long post so i would really appreciate a whole lot to those who read this but also i am sorry for any inconsistencies with this post i am really bad at writing so to start off i only have one emotion i believe i do because i do not ever feel sadness anger or anything else besides happiness i do not know if it is a habit of mine but i just smile even though i do not feel a thing i laugh when something is funny but it is been a habit of mine since i have been a kid i cannot help but laugh or smile even at serious stuff i guess i am fortunate enough to have this one but only my family can make me do that they are actually my only will to live i do not feel a single thing when there is something supposed to be sad and there should have been so many moments where i should be mad but i just cannot feel something this was more evident when my now exgf broke up with me suddenly she said that she does not love me anymore and i just did not feel a thing i loved her so much but here is the thing before she broke up with me i would feel sad worried and even mad at one point but after that i think something within me broke and i finally just gave up on everything as a whole i do not take interest anything anymore like dating i used to always want to date people as a way to escape my depression find comfort and find happiness i felt that during my last relationship side note over a few years ago i dated this girl which left me damagedscarred so badly that it still haunts me to this day i will not go into detail about that second i do not ever feel like eating anything sometimes i would go for a full 12 hours or longer without food because 1 it is a pain leaving my room and 2 i do not feel hungry i refuse to leave my room most of my time and would occasionally eat whatever i have in my mini fridge it would be bread for the most part third i have major insomnia i just cannot feel tired unless i stay up for an entire 24 hours but when i do sleep i would always wake up around 6 30pm and always at that time even if i pull an all nighter my body mentally and physically refuses to wake up earlier even though i want to but i do not have the strength for it all i do is sleep for over 14 hours i really really want to fix my sleep schedule i tried so many methods but they always all fail finally i refuse all social contact this does not apply to my family or essential workers i cannot look at people in the eye and i would always hide my face with a hat mask even if the place does not need a mask but i would still always wear it regardless of what they say i do not have anyone to text and if i do get a text i would not see it for days my speech has been getting worse because of it i live with two friends but i have not seen or talk to them in over a few days because i am always in my room i do not know if i sound so dramatic but there is something wrong with me i am extremely good at lying i hide it so we will with family and close friends who happen to see me which is super rare i just need some help also please do not tell me to go seek professional help or go to a hospital i have been to therapy in the past but i hate it i just do not feel comfortable with it face to face with someone again i am sorry for the way i type and for any inconsistencies
1,what i have been going through lately so currently i am in high school and in my psychology class we were assigned a project about mental disorders to work on over spring break and today is the last day of spring break and the project is due tomorrow and i have not started the project due to no wifi at home i have not had wifi in 3 weeks life wiithout wifi sucks but you get used to it you find other things to do what i did was drew pictures and knitted yes knitted my grandma taught me awhile ago it is actually fun until you loose the loops meaning the yarn fell off your knitting needle and you have to guess where the loops were the thing i am making is all screwed up due to that happeninh but yeah i can knit back to the no wifi thing somehow my tablet still shows i have wifiand my apps work and youtube on my tablet will not work without wifi i even have data but it still will not work so if it is working i know i am good so i hope this actually does get postedif not oh well as i stated earlier i am in high school which means i live with my parents and our landlord wants us out so he can either rent to someone else or rent the house to his daughters and to be honest the house is not in good condition when we moved in the walls were not repainted the plumbing was not fixed etc and the heater is broken when it rains the ceiling leaksand so oni actually posted what the landlord has been doing and stuff on this sub reddit awhile ago so you can check it out if you want anyways last week on thursday we recieved a notice to move out by sunday which is today we have gotten almost everything outbut still have the essentials left tv couch my parents bed and bed frame fridge mine and my brothers baby stuff that my mom does not want to lose and my dads tools we got approved for an apartment but cannot move stuff in until tomorrow at 11 00 but we have to be out by midnight tonight so instead of a hotel we are staying here for the night hoping no ones comes by to escort us out we are staying because if we went to a hotel and came back for the rest of our stuff we would lose the stuff ontop of this my dad started drinking againand yesterday he went outback to have a smoke and he somehow caught his hair on firestill not sure how it happened but i will never forget his screamit is going to haunt me forever but luckily he is okay and thank god he is he did however get slightly burned on his forehead but other than that he is alive breathing and not in the hospital before that happened i actually was thinking of cutting myself because of everything that has been going on but i was going to do deep cuts to where i would need to go to the hospital and i was going to do it but i never went through with it especially after hearing my dad scream i could not bring myself to do it due to all this moving my dog has been acting weird she is been shaking whining trying to wedge herself under chairs trying to hide under the table etc everytime i look at her she has this sad look in her eyes and i feel bad for her i think why she is like this is because she thinks we are going to take her back to the pound or abandon her but we are not the kind of people to do that she is been a part of this family for about 7 years i thinki am not sure so yeah that is my life at the moment
1,no one showed i should have expected that i have only ever had one friend in my life i have tried to make more but people hate me i have gone to community events parties hobby shopsetc to meet people people just do not seem to click with me i am seen as odd annoying weird to name a few things i have been called the only person i can call a friend is my wife and i still do not understand how that came along she just gave me a chance and looked at my oddities a little different earlier this year my wife discovered i have never had a birthday party i never really had any friends to have a party so i just never tried to have one she said that was an injustice and i should have a party and invite friends from facebook she decided to throw me a party a few weeks ago we planned it out for a month made all the decorations by hand hand cooked all the snacks and food even made our own party games to play sent out invitations to people on my facebook her friends we even got rsvps back it all seemed like my first birthday party would be fun i was hopeful coming up on the day then the day of the party happened we rushed to get it all finished before the party start and we were excited the party start time came and 30 minutes later no one was here no big problem everyone always comes to a party late 2 hours later still no one came i started to eat my snacks by myself we got various excuses throughout the night i got sick stuff has come up car is not starting no babysitters my boss just called me in my wife went to bed early she was upset and mad i told her it is ok i am strong outwardly for her i do not want her to feel bad no one likes me but i am being eaten up alive i am now in my 30s and i cannot ever said i have had a true friend other than my wife of course i am thankful she gave me a chance i do not know what is wrong with me or why i seem to be broken i never should have had this party because ever since then i just cannot get it out of my head everyone time i would say outloud to my wife or family they would tell me do not say that plenty of people are your friends you are just being negative now my wife truly sees what i mean if i would have just told my wife no to the party she would not have been upset and i would still be ignoring the problem of me being friendless edit everyone thank you for all of the birthday wishes trying to get through replies and messages did not expect this many messages thank you all again edit 2 i see a lot of messages telling me to be thankful for my wife i am very thankful for her she is the best thing that has ever happened in my life and i am the best that ever happened in hers we have been through everything together even homelessness that being said i feel as if she is not enough socially for me we are 2 different people and even though we share a lot of interests we do not share all of them sometimes it is nice to have other friends to share your other interests with too example she hates the show it is always sunny in philadelphia she hates it to a point that if i watch it it should be on my pc with headphones so she does not need to hear it i do it because i can understand it frustrates her but i love the jokes so much and i see random stuff in the world and laugh because it reminds me of iasip but i have no one to share it with except the subreddit
1,recent events have killed what little motivation i had now i am just sick due to stress 15 years ago my life was miserable my depression and anxiety were out of control i was diagnosed with a potentially deadly rare genetic disorder as well as ibd and fibromyalgia i lost so much weight i would cry when i saw myself in a mirror my mother would cry when she saw me too and my marriage was falling apart my wife left my to fend for myself and i lived alone for a year in that year i built myself back up got my health issues mental and physical under control and blossomed but i was still just existing not truly living so i did the most spontaneous thing i have ever done and moved across country leaving everyone and everything behind moving across country was the best decision i have ever made i was healthier than i would been in years i was enjoying my life doing things i would never thought i would do in short i was happy and living my best life but good things do not last forever a few years later i moved back because of family issues and some emotional manipulation on their part i came home to chaos and was instantly thrown back into the hell i had left but they my family got what they wanted so they did not really care what it cost me emotionally and physically but i still had hope i could do or be something more i still had dreams but that was 6 years ago slowly my dreams dwindled away and my hope was dying but i still tried to hang on to that until today for the last month i have been strapped for money because of some ridiculousness i have been fighting for weeks to get it back and finally i got it back today but there was a problem because why would not there be after all that fighting to get my money back my bank has decided to hold it for 3 to 7 business days the timing could not be more unfortunate i am on disability i get paid one a month and everything i have goes to paying bills but because of the issues with my money this month i have not been able to pay all my bills fortunately i got a small loan to pay my cellphone bill and borrowed money to pay my rent but what i could not do was pay anything else and right now that is a huge problem my niece lives with me and i pay the cableinternet bill she is doing distance learning and obviously need internet access to go to school earlier this month i got an extension for the internet service but now it is due tomorrow see what i mean about unfortunate timing but no one will help me and i am lost i had to send my niece to my mothers just so she could go to school but my mother does not need the extra hassle her life is stressful enough as it is but all of this has taken a toll on me and today has just broken me because of the intense stress for the last month my eczema has flared up on my face where i have never had it before my fibromyalgia and ibs have both flared up i am just sick to my stomach and i just want to curl up and sleep forever after all that fighting my bank is the one that broke me i cannot take anymore stress or i am going to end up in the hospital but that looks like what my immediate future is going to be but anyway thanks for letting me vent i wish i could say i feel better but i do not i feel withered up inside and have no more faith or trust in humanity i know there is a handful of good people out there but most are not
1,just a bunch of first world problems i am a freshman in college i was one of those people who did well in high school without really trying i knew it would be harder coming into college but a great first semester pulled me into a false sense of security i am currently sitting on a 31 seriously why are bs so fucking detrimental this would be fineish since i am a comm major and nobody in my field of work especially in my city gives a shit about your academics in college you can either do the job or you cannot problem is my scholarships and aid are riding on my grades i cannot afford to go to college without them i never learnt proper studying or time management skills so i am trying desperately to catch up but i am being buried under classes orgs and general life responsibilities i stupidly thought that managing 12 hrs with only one class that has tests and no orgs meant i could do 15 hrs with three classes that test haha nope i joined four orgs and paid the dues for all of them two of them i never attend because i do not have time so that is 80 down the toilet one of them wants too much time and the other is confusing and point opportunities are hard to come by for the past two weeks the meetings that normally go until 8 30 have been running up on 10 30 instead i am trying to take care of things that would actually help me like doctor and psych appointments doing this means i am missing classes meaning my grades suffer i am not seeing a therapist anymore because i do not have time there are so many things i have to do fees i have to pay papers i have to fill etc and i cannot do them all my family says exercise and eat well in what time how do i stick to my calories when i am constantly binging from stress i am getting back to my old weight and i hate it i cannot stand the idea of anyone seeing me naked so a love life as if i would have time for it is out of the question i will spend all day working and then realize i accomplished almost nothing because i was agonizing over a single task but i need to be a perfectionist with these things because they are such a huge part of my grade none of the things i do are interesting to me i am in an english and theatre course and i either hate them or cannot give them the dedication i want despite the fact that i love those subjects after every test i make a plan to study better but it quickly gets thrown to the wayside as other shit is piled onto my plate so now i am cramming and stressing my room is a disaster my side is always dirty because i am too overwhelmed to pick it up my roommate is a super light sleeper so i have to go to bed before i can finish my stuff just so she can get her sleep and it is not her fault but i just want to yell i am sorry you cannot sleep but i have shit to do let me fix my shitty gpa while you enjoy your 39 thanks this is not the half of it but what i can get down before i have to get back to work i am sure some of these things have easy solutions but i am too blinded by my stress sadness frustration everything i welcome any advice anyone may have these problems are stupid and unimportant in the grand scheme of things but i cannot ignore them thank you to anyone who took the time to read this and just see me and how i feel
1,i am kind of disgusted with myself i have a depression nest my bedroom is disgusting i have a path from my door to my bed and that is just about it everywhere else i have piles of clothes and old food containers and boxes and crap i do not need i have a hoarding problem on top of being too depressed to clean my dad is a pack rat too so i have always spent my life in clutter i do not think it is at tv show level but it is still bad does anyone have tipsadvice for finally cleaning up i have been trying but honestly some days i pick up like 2 pieces of trash and toss a couple things in a laundry basket and i automatically feel drained i remember when my old roommate barged in to my room mistaking i am coming for come in i was always so careful about keeping roommates out of my room always locking the door because i was never more embarrassed i saw the shock on her face as i rambled off reasons for the mess i just dumped everything in here when i moved in i have just been super busy with school and work has me exhausted i know she did not buy it she must have thought i was the nastiest person alive she asked if i wanted help but i declined and said i would handle it i never really did i can handle living in clutter it is all i have ever really known i do wish i had a super cute and organized room but on the rare occasion i do try to organize everything it never lasts but i feel so guilty guilty because i have a dog he is been my best bud for the last 15 years or so and he does not deserve this life like i said we have always lived in a cluttered house but my room is the absolute worse he gets fresh food and water and i try to take him outside often so there is no accidents in here and he gets fresh air but he still does not deserve this i know he walks around my piles of crap just fine and still runs full speed to see me when i walk through the door his tail wagging so fast that his whole little body wiggles i know he loves me and i love him with my entire heart he is one of the only things that keep me going because i am afraid of what would happen to him if i were gone i do not think my family would be the best caretakers and i saw how the poor guy grieved when my mom died i saw how he was confused and still went to her bedroom looking for her every single day for the longest time when we would pull up in the car he would race to the passenger door and wait for her to come out my family showed me how he kept finding his way into my room when i first left for college i would not want to leave him hurt and confused like that so i keep pushing on but i cannot let him keep living like this i am disgusted and deeply disappointed in myself but i will do my best to clean my room and throw some stuff away it definitely will not be anywhere close to easy but i still want to try edit wow i did not expect to get such a huge response i basically passed out on my bed right after posting this but i only expected maybe 1 or 2 people to comment also a big thanks for the awards it is been a difficult path i have been trying to clean for the past week or so and it feels like i have not made so much as a dent in the mess but i appreciate the kind words and motivation i will be reading through the comments and try to respond to as many as i possibly can
1,in 2009 i helped hurricane katrina victims hurricane ida is hard for me in 2009 i was a chemical engineering intern outside of new orleans louisiana i lived in jefferson parish and worked in hahnville louisiana outside bayou boute it was 4 years after hurricane katrina sisters of charity hospital the hospital for the poor before katrina was still closed on my weeknights i volunteered at a makeshift medical clinic operating out of a church basement and staffed by medical students residents and interns from nearby tulane university i spent my weekends building homes for habitat for humanity in the 9th ward the neighborhood hit hardest by hurricane katrina many homes still had blue tarps where the roof blew off whole streets were still full of empty and destroyed homes the neighborhood looked like pictures of bombed out neighborhoods i had seen in world war 2 documentaries fema had spray painted these homes with the number of dead bodies found inside grass grew up through the street and sidewalk lawns were littered with ruined possessions and cars the owners had either died or left and never returned we did the best we could to help we built houses on stilts higher than katrinas storm surge i looked into the faces of universityeducated people like school teachers and accountants who had been made homeless overnight it was heartbreaking we promised these people that it was going to be ok we gave them shelter we told them the worst period of their life was behind them my heart is breaking again due to hurricane ida it is different when the faces on television were your neighbors and people who touched your life they changed me for the better i am upset and disgusted that my former neighbors in new orleans have had to face two devasting hurricanes in their lifetimes i wish i could go down and help again but i am not in a position to do so my neighborhood in jefferson parish was one of the hardest hit with 10 to 15 feet of water in the street an electrical transmission tower near my old apartment collapsed and fell into the mississippi river more than 1 million customers are without electricity hospitals have been damaged and are running on backup generators hurricane ida made landfall too fast for the new orleans to evacuate people who do not have cars doctors nurses first responders and the national guard in louisiana and neighboring states are exhausted because louisiana texas alabama oklahoma mississippi georgia florida and arkansas are dealing with a devasting 4th wave of covid19 the postkatrina plan had been to evacuate hospital patients out of louisiana to surrounding states but covid19 meant that the hospitals in neighboring states were full of covid19 patients after katrina first responders and national guard from neighboring states handled the majority of the rescues and emergency response because louisiana first responders and national guardsmen had been hurt lost their homes been killed injured or had family members killed or injured those resources are not available today national guard units and first responders in neighboring states were already overburdened due to covid19 our public safety infrastructure is close to breaking down
1,having wonderful loving supportive family does not make you any less depressed i have two extremely loving parents a supportive sister and a handful of close friends who i know would always listen if i needed it i am still extremely depressed and ready to end it all i attempted suicide 4 years ago ended up in the psych ward for 2 weeks and my family and friends visited every day i can barely function anymore i try so incredibly hard every day to be normal to work walk chat and appear fine mentally i am thinking about killing myself for hours every day today i lost it blew off work and slept the entire day i cried to my mother and she cried with me asked me what i needed willing to do anything but it does not help there is not anything wrong with me i am young pretty thin and am capable of making friends and keeping them i have a stem degree i have had committed relationships none of that makes me happy the true tragedy of my life is that i know i could do more be more and i just cannot i have been told i am strong because i have not done drugs or drank because i powered through my degree because i have not killed myself i am not strong i am guilted having a family who loves you and you love is a double edged sword love does not cure depression it does wrack you with guilt if you even think of attempting it it would destroy my family i am not exaggerating they have all told me individually may times that it would my parents would never forgive themselves i would haunt them forever i tried therapy after i got out of the hospital i was on antidepressants i tried different meds i saw 4 different therapists it all just made it so much worse one of my therapists almost got me involuntarily recommitted to the hospital her talking to my parents and ensuring they would be picking me up and taking me home was the only thing that saved me even the good therapists just made me feel worse i would leave every appointment more depressed than i came in i quit trying that after a year the thing about therapy is that you are forced to lie i was suicidal but could not talk about it if they suspect anything you get the cops called on you and they forces you into the prison that is the psych ward they force medication on you get you fired from your job and destroy whatever remnants of a life you had my mother is a certified grief councillor she volunteers in hospice and regularly supports grieving people she cannot help me talking to her is pointless she will cry and beg me not to it does not make me feel better just guilty all this rambling because the truth is that i am without hope my family is dragging me through life all the love in the world and it does not make a fucking difference drugs therapy does not matter depression is a death sentence and there is no cure my only hope is to distance myself from them and one day just do it push them far enough away that they grieve me and move on that way killing myself will not affect anyone edit thank you to people who are commenting i am having a hard time finding words to reply to people i do not really express myself easily i really appreciate everyone here its nice to feel understood

1,i am a 13 year old boy who is abused and need help i am 13 years old and i live with my dad i am shared custody from my mom to my dad my dad is very abusive towards me i have been diagnosed with depression and ptsd and i have gone to the hospital twice over suicide attempts because every time i am with my dad i want to kill myself he pushes me to the limit and i am afraid that ever since i was little my dad has always beaten me with a belt even before i was old enough for school my dad has beaten me for not doing what i was told to do he yells curse words at me and uses my mother as an example of what not to be and that makes me feel sad because i miss my mom recently my grades dropped i have been having problems at school i have a hard time focusing and paying attention to what i am being taught my dad was pissed one moment he is screaming at me and cursing me out and telling me i will not achieve anything in life and telling me i am going to regret it when he is done with me my 11 year old brother also made a bad grade so he walked into my brothers room and i heard screaming and loud sound from my dad hitting him with a belt then he walked up to me and told me to give him my hand i held my hand out and he hit me extremely hard with the belt i screamed and held my hand but he told me to hold my hand out again he continue to do it over and over again then he told both of us to come in the kitchen he started yelling at us saying he was in an ass whooping mood and that he would beat us whenever we felt like it that if we did not care about our grades he would not care either that he would make us feel his pain he hit me extremely hard my hand was red and swollen i had a bruise on my wrist that was slightly swollen and stung to the touch he told me to hurry and wash the dishes before he would do it again and he did but my hand hurt too badly he threatened to hold me down i am going to kill myself if i have to continue to live with him i cannot take this anymore and no one will do anything about it i decided that when i go back to my moms on sunday i am refusing to go back to my dads this is what it is come to because he refuses to cooperate and my mom does not have enough money to get a lawyer and free legal aid takes too long so i am not going i know my dad will call the police if i do not go when they come i will talk to them and tell them my situation can they force me to go what will they do because in order to get me to go they would have to physically drag me i am in fear of my life and i do not want to die but he just pushes me to that limit so i just cannot be around him i do not know how many times i have tried to tell my dad this and even my therapists have tried to tell him this he does not care he simply denies treating me the way he does saying he is never called me the things he does on a daily basis like dumbass idiot son of a b and he even calls my brother those things and denies it then when we are in public or around other people he acts like a totally sweet person and his girlfriend thinks that i am the problem because he constantly complains about me when really it is just a big show what will the cops do about it when they come
1,i wanted to kill my self last night but instead i called an ambulance no real reason for posting i am just proud of myself for making the choice i did edit this is not what i expected thank you to all these wonderful strangers for the support in the real world only my partner knows that i even have depression because i do not want to stress people out i am honestly so overwhelmed i thought i would answer some common questions in an edit and i will slowly get to each comment as i can smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes firstly the cost i am an aussie and i have private health insurance which includes ambulance cover so it cost me nothing i cannot believe some people have to pay i would not have called if i knew i did second what happened after i called i had my live in boyfriend with me and they came in and asked me some questions eg had i overdosed self harmed etc i explained that i had accidentally missed a few days of my medication and then had several extremely stressful incidents occur over the space of the days i forgot them i called because i started to feel like i could not trust my brain and i had a plan i was worried i would act on when my partner left for work in the morning i had also had a panic attack right before i called which i had never had before and oh boy was that scary so off i went it was all very gentle and calm i basically just needed someone to watch me while i waited it out for my meds to kick in i slept in a nice room was allowed to keep my phone so i keep in touch with my partner in the morning i was given my meds i had remembered them the dish before i had various meeting were they explained that they were happy i called it was just a relapse forgetting my meds did not help i had a long meeting with a doctor where i went through everything i was first diagnosed 5 years ago with ptsd and depression and the difficulties i have had getting help i had a good doctor for a while but she moved so they set me up with a new doctor with hours the work in my work schedule and a new therapist again that work in my work schedule most psychs in my area that bulk bill do not do after 95 bulk bill in australia medical services and partially covered by our public health system medicare is the doctor only charges what they cover it is referred to bulk billing basically it is free but covered by your tax dollars they also renewed my mental health care plan my document a doctor gives that allows me to access the psyc services at little to no cost which i had not been able to renew as my new doctor could not fit me in lastly i was put in touch with a community mental health program a few streets from me who have given me a case worker i have not meet her yet but basically she will contact me regularly to see if i am ok and can be the person to find me doctors and psychologists when i am struggling too i have nicknamed her my depression pa lastly they recommended i get my dosage upped a little bit then i was realised it was about lunch time and got sushi they also rang my boyfriend a lot plus me texting him a selfie every 30 minutes on his request to keep him updated and to run down my plan moving forward
1,my life is great why do i feel down i want to start off my saying a bit about me i am a 19 year old male in first year of uni mathsphysics and i have played the piano since i was six produce music some of which is now on spotify and i am a triathlete train 1215 hoursweek ps running is my entire life though i am not great at it yet my flatmate wendy is one of my best friends over the pandemic we spent around 5 months living on our own in the same bed since not in uni halls and everything was great i have never been in a relationship and i am not ready for one i made that crystal clear to her before i even invited her to stay with me over the 5 months we had somewhat a physical relationship though we never had sex she asked why and the main was because i did not want to lead her on i told her that and would regularly check if she was okay living with me despite not having an emotional relationship i know that would not work for some people and i really liked spending my time with her throughout this time i did not see anybody from uni i was home though i kept in close contact with a girl called lisa i picked up a few running and cycling injuries and had to give up training for a few weeks and it fucking broke me still recovering but doing much better recently wendy told me she is in love with me i friendzoned her and immediately stopped anything physical that we had ever done i really want this friendship to work but she is not okay i have spent 3 nights over the past two weeks where i go to sleep at 4am waking up at 7am for training with her as she is having a panic attack i am trying everything i can she is now back home since my mum a qualified counsellor conviced here that staying in uni is not a good idea though wendy would not listen to me when i said it on top of this my cycling injury is now back and i am picking up a bad shoulder from swimming and sc work music rooms are not open and so i have not practiced piano in a month which is a big fucking deal i cannot runcycleswim how i would like to i cannot practice music and i have no motivation to produce i hate my uni degree it is really hard and i have no motivation though i know when out of this rut i will begin to enjoy it again and worst of all i cannot stop thinking about lisa i thought i did not want a relationship but she is fucking everything to me what is wendy going to do when she knows how i feel about lisa i am scared she is going to do something severe i do not know if i am falling inlove with lisa but all i know is that i would die for her you are probably wondering why i have titled this what i have but i can do a lot of great things cocky i know and yet i still look in the mirror and see a failure i just want to be satisfied with who i am but i have no love for myself i have dealt with depression not really but feeling constantly down for months on end and a developing ed which i have now overcome i do not want it to come back ps i cannot talk about this in person i have not told anybody how i feel i have tried so many times but i just see it as weak and pathetic never cried infront of anyone sober either
1,i have made the decision to give up until i kill myself i have never been happy my parents have always put themselves over me they do not keep jobs they are addicts and have never ever done something for me unless it benefitted them i remember being a 6 year old not understanding why my dad would not just give me food why did i have to tell him my moms secrets or do something for him to be fed why could not my parents just go to the store and get me advil when i am in pain why did i have to wait for them to run out of beer and then they might get it if they remembered why did i sleep on chairs because every time i asked for a mattress they were too busy i was friends with a girl when i was very young she passed away and my mom did not even take me to the funeral i self harmed at 12 and my mom looked at me and walked away my dad used to emotionally abuse me at the same time one day on christmas when there were not presents under the tree i asked my mom why and she screamed and i mean screamed at like 2nd grade me about how santa is not real because we were poor and so many other things that have just chipped away at me over time i overthink to such an extreme degree i do not think i could grow up and stay sane i have so many thoughts that race through my head that my veins feel like they are physically heating up and i want to scratch my skin off i am 16 i barely mentioned anything i have been through and i am 16 i say that because to me 16 is a fucking child i am a child and i mentally feel 60 i feel like i have gone through so much had to raise myself at such a young age overthought the universe and self analyzed myself to all shit and it all has just burned me the fuck out i dropped out because i knew my parents would not care i finally have reached a point where i am so tired i cannot even try to care i do not think i will ever get out of this burnout there is nothing to look forward to there is nothing that motivates me being a kid is the best part of life and then you grow up and work and suffer except all i have done is suffer and now i have given up i do not think or want to get a steady job to work for the next 40 years of my life just to benefit a corrupt fucking system i think about the future and i do not see one for myself and honestly that is what i want if i feel this way at 16 i do not want to grow older i do not want to have future plans i want to fuck around and then kill myself because there is truly no place in this world where i would be happy call me lazy and selfish but this life is so fucking stupid we come here to suffer and work some get to suffer less and some get to suffer more and why you may ask there is no why we are on a rock suffering doing all this labor and we do not even know why we are here or why we are doing it we follow these governments and do what they say because what else can we do we live paycheck to paycheck with only a couple days off and then back to being a slave i do not really have an idea for what happens in the afterlife but i genuinely do not care anymore i do not because this life i am living now leaves a rotten taste in my mouth and i cannot fucking stand it that is all
1,i am black i am scared tired and i am at the end of my rope with life jesus how do i even start as you could read by the title i am a black man i have always been in the fight grew up with racism in all its forms in my country which ironically usually denies there ever being racism in any way the kind of shit i have heard through my entire life has molded me into someone with no selfesteem sense of selfworth voice and made into introvert because of the mentality of you need to work twice as hard as everyone out there i always saw the future as bleak tiresome and as more struggle this never really changed it just got worse with time with college and the awful reality that came afterwards i have been depressed for most of my life with my initial diagnosis at age 9 i still have it with severe anxiety my first suicidal thoughts came at age 8 and then and there i already hated myself for everything for not being enough for not being what the world wanted for failing myself at being the best for never getting anything good out of my own life for never letting myself rest or be human and with all the recent events like the absurd police brutality worldwide the rise of authoritarianism in my country with being worked to the bone and around the clock due to the pandemic with my country quickly moving up to be the worst afflicted by covid19 and my mom and me being in danger during these times by living in a neighbourhood near a place where a white supremacist parade happened which also happens to be a place where a lot of people are simply disrespecting quarantine all of this shit is just wearing me down really badly i wake up exhausted i cannot deal with anything without having a serious bout of anxiety or anger outbursts followed by fullscale breakdowns i am feeling guilty by worrying my friends and my mom i feel guilty by feeling tired by feeling afraid i feel guilty by not feeling brave enough to go out on the streets for my people and taking action i feel guilty for existing i am so fucking exhausted and i do not know what to do i just want it all to end i just want to go somewhere else i cannot handle anything anymore edit all of this support i am very very thankful for it i think i have never felt this supported in my whole life all of your words have touched me deeply i am so glad you helped me i feel more hopeful more energized from talking to you all thank you thank you all from the bottom of my heart you have all stopped me from doing something terrible today thank you edit 2 wow i was not expecting this kind of response from so many people i am trying to respond to everyone but i think i cannot i would like to thank you all once more for all your words i am very glad that i vented about all these feelings here with you all i feel so much support from you and i feel like my feelings are valid and worth feeling it may seem a bit dramatic but i am legitimately walking out of this with a different outlook on life i never expected to see so many people i do not know just rush in to support me when i am in my absolute worst so thank you once more for being here for me i mean it i love you all
1,is this a bad coping mechanism to be short my stress stems from other people being stressed i myself personally have no real issues but this pandemic has made life hard for people i care about and thus causes my stress the biggest one is a friend of mine who because of the pandemic and her health issuesweak immune system she has been unable to consistently keep a job this year i help her as best i can driving her to workinterviews she has no car lending her money which i know will not be repaid anytime soonthrough no fault of hers and has depleted my savings account she also has depression and because of all of this has been having more and more low days her roommate also has depression and recently it culminated in him having a breakdown on a bad day and pulling out his gun wanting to end it all thankfully we called his best friend and sister and they convinced him to go to a doctor and get help but i know this just compounds my friends anxiety about being a burden on him because she herself has been unable to pay rent the past few months note he has a very good paying job and does not necessarily need her rent he mostly wanted a roommate for the company but its still a source of great guilt and shame for her she just found out today that her seasonal job decided not to keep her on and she has to hunt for another job again and it makes me worried about her even though she seems level headed about it right now and i do not feel like she is a huge risk right now but i know i still need to keep an eye on her and check in the coping mechanism perhaps this was triggered by her roommates breakdown but through part of the day i have just been running the scenario through my mind what if she does kill herself i run it through my head how i might act or feel who i would call what life might be like for me afterwards and feel the emotions of the imagined scenario wash over me even as i think about it from a practical standpoint the reason i call this a coping mechanism is because this is not the first time i have done this almost everyone i knowam close to has depression and is on meds one of these friends i drove to the hospital after her suicide attempt a few years ago a different friend and i was her crutch at the time like i am for this friend almost all of my depressed friends i have run through the horrible scenario in my head and had the thoughts of what would i do how would this effect my life physically and emotionally i do my best to be available for my friend while trying to keep my own mental health in check even though i feel guilty when i say i cannot hang out with herdo not have the spoons to drive to her place as she lives 30 minutes away and while i am helping her financially i know i cannot keep doing it but i try to help her when she needs rides or small things but other than that there is not much else i can do to help her its all been horrendous bad luck out of our control i know this thought process probably is not normal but could it just be this weird coping mechanism i am doing to try and assert some sort of control of the situation or am i a complete sociopath for running the scenarios in my head
1,a lot of things all at once i seek this group because i do not feel i cannot be this open to anyone else if you see my life from outside it looks like i am in a good point if my life i am on my last year of my phd doing my research on a prestigious research center it seems that i may have some job offers already and i have make friends living in a beautiful and safe european country in comparison to my originary latin american country that is very dangerous and infested with covid apparently i have done a good job in the lab where i am doing my research because oftenly i receive praise from my superiors and other collaborators i have many reasons to be grateful and i am i am really am however i fell like shit this year took a toll on me my dad died on may and i could not travel to the funeral do to traveling restrictions by that time i was recovering from some serious issues with my girlfriend and even do we sort it out it was very stressful and difficult for me i am happy with my job however i had to do a lot of sacrifices to be where i am now i have faced a lot of chritique when i came here leaving my family and my girlfriend but i have endure iti have done my best to help other people to come here so they do not face the same problems that i had in the moment but i feel that slowly this has become my unofficial responsability to the point that when i put limits because i need to focus on my projects or myself my superiors get angry and keep pressuring me until i help my colleagues if someone do a mistake is not a big problem because they are new and they are learning if i do a mistake i should pay more attention or dedicate more time because i am have been the longest in the lab to add salt to the wound i am not the best administrator and i have terrible notion of dates and time so i screw it up and i have to pay some fines for delay payments that even do are not impossible to pay it kind of screw some wedding plans we have with my girlfriend delaying it even do she is very understanding one of the chritique from some friends and family in my country is that i did not married her before coming to study and actually that lead to the previous problem i mentioned so this delay do not help with my newly discover anxiety i have seen how all of this have slowly take me down one step at a time it is 4 40 am and i cannot sleep i wake up suddenly i literally sleep all weekends it has become incredibly difficult to clean my two room apartment or throw away a bag of trash or wash my dishes or take a shower i know is getting worse but somehow everytime i decide to seek for help i think probably i am exaggerating sequels of my latin american mentality i also have trouble to tell this to my friends because i do not want them to worry and i love them but they are the worse giving advice when i was a kid i used to cry until falling sleep when i face this kind of feelings but i cannot i really wish i can i just want to cry and free myself but i have try a lot of things without success at least writing this gave me some relief i want to thank you for this group and i am sorry for my bad english and the long post
1,anxiety depression ptsd from childhood trauma 30 years later any insight appreciated backstory i would like to tell my story in hopes someone can offer some insight about where to go from here or assurance that i am not alone the pandemic has not treated any of us well myself included i had two nonlifealtering events occur about 10 and 7 months back that spun me out with some disproportionately intense anxiety and i started questioning a lot of stuff about my behavior sanity and even intellectual capability for years i would been having intrusive thoughts i kept dismissing as just a bad habit or related to stress they are mostly selfcritical sometimes slightly paranoid in content as the pandemic fell upon us these thoughts got way intense i was shushing myself out loud in front of people sometimes because i could not think or listen to the radio or anything without them inundating my mind they have since calmed down a little over the summer and i am pretty scared of going back there i did not even know they were intrusive thoughts until maybe a month ago i really thought i might have a mental illness or intellectual disability i am still very confused about how i feel since i got my vaccine i have felt comfortable going to the drs office and brought up what i thought was anxiety i had a blood test results fine and after some screening questions my dr asked me if i was depressed i did not think so at the time but my symptoms primarily early morning awakenings rumination the thoughts and not sadness but a discomfort i cannot describe more closely match depression than anxiety so i have been given a script for some antidepressants i do not know that i am ringing all the bells for depression or anxiety though here is where i need some insight i am extraordinarily uncomfortable discussing with my dr how i feel my voice is shaky and i feel like i am fighting back tears with a queasy feeling in my chest i was asked at one point if i experienced childhood trauma while i had not considered my childhood traumatic before i knew it was not ideal now i am looking into childhood trauma and i am hitting many points on the list i would been threatened with abandonment lived a parent who abused alcohol witnessed domestic violence and it was frequently a hostile environment yelling slamming cabinets and doors and such having a child of my own now i am questioning other aspects of my upbringing i am a grown man and i have lived with this for 30 years i feel fucked up that i am this terrified of how i feel my intrusive thoughts and how emotionally volatile it feels to discuss my feelings with a dr i can maybe see how some of my experiences in childhood are effecting my adult behavior i do not know if pushing it all down again and moving on is a solution is this discomfort something that can be corrected why is this happening now the stress of the pandemic i cannot be the only person in their late 30s going bananas and wondering from where this came from right i have started getting help i will try the antidepressants and see if i can stabilize but where do i go from here if you made it here thanks for your time
1,therapy just made me more aware of how isolated i feel because most people suck at empathy i have been in therapy for years in that i have been able to identify what has made me so depressed growing up and i try to deal with it i spend a lot of time using coping methods and trying my best for a depressed person i manage to excel in life currently dealing with the sting of a breakup went on vacation to asia and ex broke nc before my trip to wish me well after what i gather was him finding out the grass is not greener i am on a dream vacation with my older sister and her child while we visit her fianc a lot of my depression is triggered from a childhood of being parentified and also unappreciated and invalidated my sister spent my formative years teasing me for liking asian culture and is now jet setting to my fantasy destination because of romantic love was not enough that i liked something or it meant something to me for her to care or treat me right nope only a man would make her culturally open and respect me and my interests i was livid i had been journaling using positive self talk etc but all i could think is wow people only care about me when i can offer them something creative services language skill advice emotional supportchild careif there is not a task or skill i can do people rarely give a fuck about me i did not want to share this and told her i needed a moment to collect myself and she kept bothering me until i cried at a shrine i told her why i was upset and she kept telling me to put it aside because we are on vacation i turned on my data to call my mom she told me to pay a tour guide to take me places and hung up on me when i asked to be heard instead of throwing money at my feelings i literally just wanted someone to put themselves in my shoes for 2 seconds and be a brokenhearted 20 something who is the third wheel to a family and a newly wed couple but is trying her fucking best i did not need to spend more money on experiences i did not need to pretend i was not upset i just fucking wanted someone to walk in my very capable shoes for 30 seconds and realize the only thing i want is a little goddamn empathy my family rarely thanks me for things they do not care unless i am in crisis or isolating i have learned to ask for what i need but it does not matter because unless i have extreme reactions they cannot be bothered to hear me i am happy for my sister i truly am but jfc i am planning and helping with her wedding in the midst of a serious breakup which she also teases me about and infantilizes my heartbreak feelings do not go away because you are on vacation therapy taught me to deal with my shit but unless i act in bad old ways my family does not react i am more than a babysitter or a social media paparazzi i am part of this family too tldr depression reared it is head on exotic vacation talking through issues got me yelled at edit whoathanks for the gold did not really expect this but if you are a depressed empathy like me i know it is hard and i know it is lonely trying to do good while being profoundly depressed with people and their actions well get through it
1,feeling like a worthless run down person i feel like a massive pile of sht person i am 32 my husband 30 died last year from cancer after 19 months of fighting and several times of thinking he was in the clear we were told there was nothing left they could do after he seemed perfectly healthy for months and he died 45 days later i ended up taking him off life support maybe he could have come out of it maybe i should have left him on longer maybe i robbed him of one last conversation he could have had with his parents with his friends with me but what did i do after my husband passed away you ask naturally i cried and drank and awkwardly spent time with friends and family but two months later i slept with one of his best friends my whole life had been my husband and taking care of him i stopped working and was with him full time in a instant he was gone and i was left not a whole person i tried to fill that missing piece and justified it with he knew and loved him too said friend developed feeling for me i said i knew i could not commit to that but still took the attention then pretty much ghosted months moved on i have slept with other people not looking to date anyone some of them hurting me and me hurting some of them either way empty i do not want to date anyone but still want some company to feel good everything with my husbands estate has been an issue taxes the business property i try paying professionals to help me deal with these things and more fuck ups keep happening and i keep having to fight to get things done i have started procrastinating and avoiding some of these things now but i know if i do not do them no one will and the stress is weighing me down we got a puppy when she he was looking healthy she is now 16 months she is got some anxiety and aggression issues i got a trained i have been working with for months training methods did include some negative reinforcement techniques prong or ecollar today my dog tried to nip at me for looking at her broken nail i yelled no loud and gave her a firm tap she immediately cowered and i have been trying to build her back up with treats and play but she is still sulking i feel like i failed her that maybe i hired the wrong professional trainer for her that i was too harsh when she nipped at me that i am not enough fun to build her back up maybe i cannot give her the life she deserves my apartment is being sold i am month to month it is possible i get a 30day notice to leave with new owners all my stuff all my late husbands things are here it would be a huge process to organize and sort all his things both personal and paperwork for his now closed business but like i said tax issues and bad accountants oh and i shoved a bra in the garbage can i front of everyone at victorias secret today thinking it was the not buying bin it was pretty evidently a garbage can then i lost my house key while walking my dog at 11 30 and my best friend had to come get my door open my bain feels like literal moosh and i want to crawl in a hole and not deal with anyone or anything ever again i feel like a trash human
1,stressful day spoiler alert this post is mostly venting but any advice or kind words are appreciated after 4 days of waking up unwillingly early in the morning and being unable to sleep again this morning i woke up with a chest on my stomach and tingling in my lungs when breathing deeply as well as general malaise body pain notclear mind but no fever or bad cough or else last weekend i went out for lunch with a couple friends who recently recovered from covid and i have also seen my paternal grandparents and another couple friends since besides sharing every meal with my parents my other grandpa 91 yo still not vaccinated against covid19 is coming back from the hospital tomorrow after undergoing surgery for a tumour and my parents will go there to help set him up as he will require care i am not only unable to go help them but also hit with anxiety of potentially having contracted covid and having passed it to them as well as to my other grandparents andor friends who thanks goodness are all vaccinated plus i am writing my phd thesis which i need to deliver in a month and i have got no time to waste being sick i could postpone but i would rather not plus i have not seen my longdistane boyfriend in a month he is supposed to pass by for a few days in a couple weeks and i really need to see him so much that my feverish mind spinning thoughts at 200 kmh was thinking how much i would want to fuck him holding him against the wall and suck his dick at least some good thoughts plus my bf and i collaborate on a research projects and another of our coauthors suggested inviting another senior professor to work on the project with us which would help our chances to publish it in a good journal but might reduce our contribution to it i know he and i have somewhat different views on how to manage this issue but i should decide about it soon and i do not feel clearminded enough to do so plus i have been somewhat down in the past months better now and tend to be needy at times so i am also concerned that letting him know i really miss him and need him might make me less attractive in his eyes and he acknowledged he is not very skilled at offering support to me in this instances i have booked a covid test for tomorrow at noon and hope it will go well but anyway better know one way or the other i just hope and know that everything will turn out fine one way or another but i really do feel alone and stressed not even unable to cope with things because i know i can do it but i would just wish it were easier to get some muchneeded support especially from my bf who is the most important person i would want to rely on wishing for a brighter tomorrow and glad to hear any advice you might have on how to better cope with things as mentioned i have been feeling vulnerable and easily taken down in the past months due to a combination of factors covid jobrelated rejections i am picking myself up but sometimes it still feels hard to cope with all the shit which objectively is not even that bad given the much bigger problems that many people are facing these days

1,what is the real problem with me i have always wondered why i never had any friends it is been an unfortunate consistency throughout my life i am moderately attractive with good personal hygenie i am very generous with my time and money i will bend over backwards for the people in my life that i care about and love i am genuine honest trustworthy empathetic compassionate and loyal however nobody wants to be my friendnot even when i was a child i am almost 53 years old and have never had a best friend that i could trust and rely on i have had people that i knew at work or school and we seemed to get along well enough however they would never accept my invites to go hang out and do fun things together i have heard that if the problem is across people that means everywhere you go and all the people you meetthen it is you in the beginning i brushed it off and thought i was just dealing with a bad person or our personalities did not match upetc butnow that i am nearly 53 the issue seems much deeper and i am trying to unravel the true issue here i have had really nice cars and a nice house to host a party or social eventnobody agrees to come over they are all too busyall the time it is always some excuse as to why they are not available i have become extremely aware of my myself emotionally and i have taken the time to listen to others i will hear someone say no to me but theni will hear them agree to hang out with another person and the excuse they gave me never came up example i will ask someone to go to a movie and they will say something likei just have too much to do thanks for the invite but maybe another time another person will ask them to do something on the same day and they will say sureyeah i would really like that sounds like fun i will see you at 7 30 i scratch my head and think what is so bad about me that nobody wants to spend time with me that type of thing has happened more times than i can count i have even started to experiment with things and sayhey want to have lunch tomorrow i will pay for everythinglet us just hang out and have a good time the answer is stillthanks for asking but my wife has all these errands she wants me to do tomorrow sorry man i pretty much make it irresistible and they still say no i am just perplexed i am beyond puzzled i do not get it i cannot even get a friendship started because it takes two to make that workyou know anyway i do not really know what advice i am searching for on here i guess i just wanted to air it out everyone needs friendship it is something you crave like food hydration or sleep it is a very natural part of life but for some reason it is just never been available to me i feel exceedingly alone and unworthy i have even bluntly asked people to tell me the truth but they always spin up some excuse as to why they are not available the timing is off the weather their wife has errands they need to run they are not feeling well maybe next weeketcetc thanks for listening and maybe there is someone out there with a similar story
1,i have no desires no ambitions hell i do not even think my life can be considered living but i love it and i think i will continue to live like this as long as i can only feeling alive when it rains i live through stories through dreams through other people eyes i think i have got a lot of empathy for some reason i lose myself in everything movies books shows videogames i do not care which life i follow as long as it is not my own i do not feel sad even though sometimes i feel suicidal i even got an attempt behind me i do not really care i am 23 and i had a difficult life full of loss and sickness and i do not care for that either i am not a dumb person but i did not and neither intend to follow through with my studies i do not want a job either even though i think i will have to get one in order to get by i just want to live throughout my stories i want to lose myself in there forever i really wish the afterlife will be just that an amalgamation of lives where i forget everything and every time start anew but when i die i remember all the previous ones i have lived for some reason though there is always something that truly makes me feel alive something that makes me happy and with which i share an incredible connection on so many levels the rain i love the rain so much i always end up with a smile on my face whenever it starts to pour down it is like some kind of miracle of nature and every time i wish it could go on forever rain is amazing it is so dynamic and refreshing the smell of dust it leaves it is the absolute best and it feels like when i can finally smell it when it starts raining in that moment i truly feel alive in no other instance i can feel that way or can i replicate it i do not care for love but i think i am in love with this weather i think i only live to see the next time it will rain over and over also the same way the rain makes me feel alive the sun makes me feel dead inside and in pain a physical pain it often enough translated into the real world i swear it has debilitated me in many occasions the heat i cannot stand it the sweat brings stickiness it burns my eyes the sky becomes so monotonous it could just be dead for all i cared really the sun sucks i often wish for it to disappear forever i do not care if i would die or the planet and all the people in it would die i really just want it gone every single day of my life my first thoughts when i wake up every single day are is it raining please please make it so today will be a rainy day i do not really know why i am writing this maybe i hope to find someone who can understand me even though i doubt anyone even in a situation similar to mine could feel in exactly in the same way as i do i think this world is amazing and that life is worth living but i hate the sun and i have having to do things i do not want to do in order to be able to enjoy it is wonders it surely seems like the kind of cry a baby would do but it is a very strong sentiment i do not want to work i do not want to do nothing i just want to read books and enjoy the falling rain forever

1,so i have this virus depressionexe on my computer about a year ago i realized my computer was running slower than usualof course this took me a few weeks to realize since the decrease in performance was gradual once i realized i opened the process tab and find this program depressionexe running hogging a lot of my cpu i am fairly sure it is a virus but the weirdest thing is that i have not been downloading anything that would contain a virus and as far as i can tell it does not even have a function its only purpose is to hog cpu and make it more difficult to perform basic functions so anyway i try closing it but nothing happens i try again until windows gives me the typical depressionexe is not responding obviously i click close now and wait a bit but still nothing happens i keep clicking everywhere and mashing buttons to end the program psa this is an awful idea trying to do too much will only overload your computer but my desktop only freezes oh well i say i will just restart the computer and hope that tomorrow i will have more success in getting rid of the virus the next week or so i keep mashing buttons and hitting end now but again this only overloads my computer and forces me to shut down for the day meanwhile the virus has been getting greedier and is taking up more and more of my cpu programs run slower and i experience more stutters and lags in processing eventually i gave up trying to end depressionexe by conventional means and sought antivirus software the software was a bit of a pain to install at first and costed a chunk of change and unfortunately did no good sure it was able to detect the virus it turns out that it is not so uncommon but was useless in actually removing it i had the same experiences with other antivirus software not powerful enough did not detect the problem misidentified the virus the list goes on i still try to run antivirus software once a week just in case but most of the time it just uses up even more cpu some other users try to help but it is obvious they never had this malware have you tried turning it on and off again sometimes when my computer is overloaded i just need to delete a lot of processes for a bit or it will run quickly again you will see they do not understand just how terrible depressionexe is it is difficult because i rely on this computer for school work you name it when i first had the virus it was not too difficult to still carry out my responsibilities but since the virus has grown it is become much more difficult some days the computer will not even boot up i miss assignments and fall behind all because of this awful virus i see others whose computers run just fine and wonder what i did to get this virus and how my computer is just so different compared to theirs when we have the same model some days i just want to scrap my computer even though i cannot afford a new one edit thanks so much for the positive response guys i have enjoyed reading all your responses and hope you get a hug for every bad day you have had

1,i just want a hug that is all it will not fix my depression and it will not fix my existence everybody that is dear to me lives far away i pretend to be alright to my family and parents because i am scared to break it to them because they might react with disbelief and tell me i should calm down i did not have a real sincere hug in actually i do not know i think like 7 years i just want someone to hug me and tell me shit will be alright i do not care if it is true or not i am introverted and why and would never for the sake of me engage in any physical contact like hugging with someone that gets me and that i like i am also scared of telling people i do know and that know about my depression because i think i would look weak and that they would make fun of me or whatever even though that is very unlikely i just want to feel like a human again i really just want to have someone i like check in on me and not just send a meme and then be on their merry way i just really truly and from the bottom of my heart want a genuine hug i am just that starved of physical contact because i act and pretend that i do not like it while i wish for nothing else other people see me as this strong independent guy doing his thing going his own way and keeping his head up high while infact i just want to curl up because i cannot deal with doing a single mistake why do i have to be like this i cannot expect people do help me how i would need it if i do not tell them on the other hand i am scared because i am paranoid to be starved in the back i feel like i will never be able to open to someone completly ever again especially not in person even though that is the one and only thing i want to do edit i really want to just thank you all for comenting and upvoting i mean i did not think for this to be successful in helping me a bit atleast i kind of just wrote this because i had a huge mental breakdown and did not know what to do anymore you guys commenting are not filling the void i want filled because that is basically impossible for you to do but do not be fooled i appreciate every single person that commented here giving good vibes some people wrote they feel it and also want a hug i just want to say feel hugged atleast by me i love all of you writing here and i am really thankful for your support and you guys being so nice and cute good vibes to you all and i hope all of you feeling bad find a way to cope with shit and get better 3 edit 2 i am really overhwelmed by all of you guys coming here i am sad seeing so many people in the same state as me but i am so happy some of you try to give the best advice they possibly can maybe i have not found myself but let me tell you every single one of you commentin changed something for me do not care who you are or where you are from all of you are worth something and even though alot wrote this probably will not change anything you taking the step to write a comment that does change something i appreciate everyone here and you all got my respect for dealing with this shit illness but trying to look out for each other i love all of you 3
1,talking to my dr tomorrow about adjusting my meds hi all first time posting in rdepression i f42 have probably been battling it all my life but it was manageable until i had kids i likely have mild add as well i used very intense exercise to cope with both before i still exercise every day but i cannot do it with the same intensity that i used to because of my age previous injuries and just the fact that i have no time to recover from intense workouts my main symptoms are irritability likely caused by anxiety feelings of hopelessness and loss of interestinability to experience happiness i go through the motions but do not experience enjoyment on any level i feel insecure and stressed in social situations i have worked with a therapist before have gone through many in fact but have found the process unhelpful and even harmful at times but that is a different post i struggled for a year and a half to find a medication that would work for me but i am extremely sensitive to side effects here is a list of what i have tried so far and the effects i experienced both good and bad zoloft sertraline drowsiness emotional flatness loss of interest and creativity some relief from tearfulness trintellix vortoxetine upset stomach gi issues no discernible relief from depression prozac fluoxetine very intense headache only took it once lamictal lamotregine off label allergic reaction itching redness lexapro escitolopram hair loss nausea no relief from depression wellbutrin bupropion anxiety nausea no discernible relief from depression cymbalta duloxetine i was prescribed this but was actually too terrified of the side effects to take it adhd meds adderall headache backache major crash helped with interest and focus but i felt too bad to do much dexadrine headache with crash helped with interest but not focus ritalin sedating vyvanse helpful with interest mood and focus extreme irritability with crash i am currently only taking 25 mil of sertraline any more and i cannot get up off the couch any less and i do not sleep at night it is obviously not cutting it but i am absolutely terrified of taking anything else i do not have a support system to take up the slack if i am sick for longer than a day or two my relatives all live far away and they are not very helpful anyway my husband works all the time as he is the main breadwinner i have a friendly neighbor or two but not someone who would take the kids for more than a few hours it is me or nothing and i think that might be a big contributor to my problems i am talking to my psychiatrist tomorrow but i know he is kind of out of ideas i am thinking about asking for the lowest dose of vyvanse possible i have no clue what to do about the antidepressants he does not want to repeat a medication and he does not want to prescribe older meds as they tend to cause more side effects is there anything we might have missed are there any combinations or supplements that can make side effects more tolerable thanks in advance
1,being feminine in male body so today i was playing games with random people and you know sometime toxic is unavoidable and this the first time i got this comment after long time i never hear it they call me with the most word that i try to forget because bad memory sissy is in another languange suddenly i got triggered and bring back childhood trauma in my head they do not even know me and i became paranoid then i start shivering shakin and scared the braveness that i have been building this time suddenly its more like mask and it shattered i feel i back to my old self here how trauma build in my life when i was elementary school i was so dumb no one even wants to friend with me and if they do they will use me but the most mockery that they call me was because i am act like girl they have some nickname for bullied me and its really hard my feelin i do not want even type it even if its not mean at all but there bad meaning there all boys were afraid or disgusted to have same chair as me eventho i was not even gay before but still the girl did not bother to help me they sometime involved to mock me with that nickname but i do not want everyone even girls to hate me so i laugh it off to make them happy it was 6 year of painfullness with everyone in school not teacher call me that nickname they sure not punch me in the face or something like that but they punch me with their bad mouthing like you already act like girl why you make it worse with you are stupidity the other example everyone did not believe what i said or what i hear they think i am so stupid even if i do something smart or maybe the man stuff its impossible because its unmatched with my image and sometimes all of this is still haunting me like today my parents are no helping even my siblings my dad and brother its really boomer and really homopobhic sometimes if i act like girl too much they will offend me with act like queer on tv with intentions it looks like me and please stop act like girl i just can cry because i have no strength even though i was have courage to fight my pride i always lose to my brother strengthness and end up scared to all boys so yeah even family i cannot trust them too so after elementary school of hell i try to hide my feminism as much as i can but kind of fail sometimes but its not too feminime like myself in elementary so everyone do not bother to bully me anymore but i became lonely because i am not really myself and i even forget how i was now i am afraid to believe in people and have though everyone is hate me and i am not important in every event which makes me hate myself to look at mirror or took photo and video i try to avoid all of it as much as i can so i do not feel shitty and disgusted to myself anymore to make me happy if i have a little energy left sometimes every time i am about to sleep i use my imagination if i have trusted two best friends and have big confident to be who i am and many imagination to make me look stronger sn yes i was crying typing this grinning_face_with_sweat
1,slowly i did not realize i was already killing myself first i killed the athlete there was not much of him to begin with so it was easy at the least he tried to give an effort to materialize during my college days he even joined some after school group of friends to play with that did not really go anywhere next i killed the gamer he was easy to kill too because of the need the corporate life taking much of my time did not leave enough breathing room for him to keep up a fight his antics still surface every now and then making me wish for adventures and the blood pumping suspense or action of his previous endeavors i just stuffed his mouth with career dreams he did not really struggle as he believed that to asphyxiate was actually reasonable next i killed the party boy this one took a little bit more orchestration than the previous two i had to kill his connections with his friends i had to starve him of his former social saturation and in a way that he will not easily recourse back i made his friends believe he did not need the contact that he was happy the party boy slowly lost his spirit that is when i went for the jugular to end his pain next i killed the musician i almost did not like killing him he is the most recent one and the most difficult one to get rid of he has support your see all the feelings and emotions closing through him everytime he hears plays or sings a song gives him enough strength to push back he is even made a solid group of friends that push and pull him to their graces but an opening came in the guise of leaving the country that tiny waver in his resolve let me sneak in a stab it was easy enough from then on i am just afraid that eventually i might kill the writer too and when i do i do not really know what is left i am actually surprised to realize that i have been hurting myself without physically doing so i have lost more of myself in the past few months than i ever had in years and i am not making any more of me than what i already have ps i wrote this to myself at a bad time about a year ago and putting what i have been doing in words has surprisingly help me curb and slowly regain myself throughout the past year i still get spans of time where i feel like nothing where i feel afraid of being nothing that i would rather just lose my life but remember all you have been through things may not feel the best now but you are not worthless you matter there is a value to everything you have done and accomplished so let us all hold on and hold tight edit thank you so much for giving my first gold kind stranger and to everybody who is commenting i wish i had more time to reply to all of you i am surprised with the turnout and even more with how people feel the same and areis going through losing parts of themselves let us all keep holding on to those and try our best not to lose more than we do and for those who feel empty it is never too late to find yourself let us all fight for it even if it starts with just getting up from your bed in the morning

1,after three months of almost crippling depression i finally had the courage to call and make an appointment with a therapist and i am very proud of myself i have been struggling with depression for about three months now i have had severe depression social anxiety and panic attacks in the past from 2016 to beginning of 2018 harmed myself and tried suicide a few times but i started a treatment took medications and got cured i guess depression never leaves right we just learn how to deal with it and control it but it is probably never truly gone that makes me terrified but i might me wrong but now all of this feelings are coming back and i am panicking i have no motivation whatsoever to go to work i am arriving at least one hour late every single day i cry every morning and every night i am becoming paranoid with my boyfriend and relationships in general thinking no one would want to be with me because i am a failure i get too anxious to reply to anyone i am feeling alone abandoned ugly insecure unworthy stupid weak i tried to create a to do list to get me occupied stop using the uber app to go to work when i can perfectly walk it is just 27 kms or about 16 miles cook my own meals and stop ordering from an app or eating junk food start exercising my apartment building has a gym where i can use wherever i want go to bed early wake up in time have breakfast before leaving the house reply to all the messages i have been avoiding for months start to be productive at work and stop scrolling through reddit get out of my art block and start drawing again post more things on my artistic social media so i can be more active start applying for jobs i do not get paid enough and hate my current job finding a new apartment to stay my roommate is my exes cousin so its a bit weird just simple things i thought i could handle and that would make me feel way better with myself but i cannot i literally cannot every time i try to get out of bed in the morning i cry because i simply cannot i walk in front of the gym and just want to cry cannot even step on it sometimes i can even put on my gym clothes i turn on my computer i just want to die my energy starts to drop drastically and its an exhausting task to read my emails and start working i am always procrastinating and pushing people away i think the thing that is bothering me the most is that i cannot achieve the simplest goals and i am failing even on the silliest things in day life i do not have suicidal thoughts anymore neither the urge to hurt myself so sometimes i just feel like this might not be depression it is just perhaps me not trying hard enough but either way i cannot live like this anymore i have been deeper before but that does not mean my life is wonderful it took me a few weeks to finally defeat my social anxiety and finally called the therapist my appointment will be next friday i am very nervous but relieved i really hope things get better from now on so i can have a normal life again
1,pfmlfmla for this nightmare edit i spoke with my hr as well as my psychiatrist it looks like i do qualify and i am currently working it out with them now i am going to try making this short but i do not think i can been dealing with clinical depression and anxiety since i was 8 i made a career move into it back in 2015 after i got married basically we both agreed i was miserable where i was and that i needed to quit and finish school okay done got an as in it sec got an entry level job at a financial institution worked there for a year busted my ass got a promotion and a pretty decent raise already put me financially ahead of where i had been at my previous job was doing really well i was homelabbing at least a few times a week going to the gym lost a shitton of weight finally got my adhd treated then here comes a toxic coworker that did almost nothing and complained about literally everything at this point i was the middleguy sysadmin there taking care of the servernetwork environment guy suffered pretty terribly from depression but his mode of coping was to just trash everyone and bring everyone else down having dealt with depression for essentially my entire life i felt bad for the guy and helped him when i could but him being there planted a seed that would slowly grow into the darkest place i have ever been he was there for a year and a half before my manager finally got his head out of his ass and replaced him it was already too late for me every time a user would talk to me i would immediately be frustrated i stopped doing things that i thought were stupid and all around my work ethic basically disappeared made a terrible decision to jump to an msp basically like outsourced it for those uninitiated seemed like a great happy group of people and i needed that in my life fast forward to just over 2 years i do not even know who i am anymore i never ever wanted children but mistakes happen and now i have one i love him dearly but i cannot stop thinking about how i have forced him into this shitty world i cannot remember the last time i have slept more than a couple hours at a time i am fat again and this job does nothing but pile on work despite literally nobody having time to do any of it i cannot shut off from this place i would like to make it work but unless i can get my depression in check it will cost me my job soon i know because i was recently spoken to about it i guess in summation is depression something that can qualify for pfml hell even regular fmla though now that i have a child to support i do not think i can float the bills for too long so any amount of pay will help i cannot do this anymore and certainly not alone i do not know how much longer i can keep doing this sorry for the wall of text for something that should have been very short but now that i have made myself cry i will stop
1,being traumatised by a depression hi guys first time posting here but read over the years here and there some posts well as in the title here my situation 3 years ago i started analytic therapy had a girlfriend that time and some heavy anxiety made things very difficult my father died when i was 14 which made it later then hard to love someone without fear well it went really good actually till 2020 the relationship was a lil toxic for me it had a very polarising dynamic it made me depressive september 2020 came along and one day to another it hit me with panic cry attacks mental breakdowns i started taking medication elontril us is wellbutrin or something it is simply a bupropion derivate nevermind it was heavy and after a long path of heavy pain i never experienced in my life before the relationship ended now since march a long and slow positive trend happened i basically have no social anxiety what so ever talking to many people and going out actually helps me i also have barely heavy self doubts i like myself and i think i do not deserve this depression at all my main thing is hopelessness that it is or will be chronic that it never ends and i will end up having it forever i have a strong family and friends holding my back and all those actually positive things should make my depression way better or push me out of that but it does not which worries me even more now i experience a small downwards spiral againwell i am studying physics and it is stressful recently so there might be the reason now to my big worries which may be part of depressive thoughts person_shrugging face_with_raised_eyebrow the biggest because of all my shit at the moment is a clearly noticeable wrong affection i see something or feel something or smell something and a depressive feeling comes up no i hate my self or i do not deserve etc no thinking problem rather a feeling problem it is simply just that my own reality seems heavily distorted and i am so good damn fucking afraid of another hell like late 2020 it makes me panic to think about that happening again this depression traumatised more than anything in my distant past my depression gave me such a trauma that it seems to stay it induced it self and i have such a fear that there is now solution to this at all i do not see me as a person how is always struggling with depression it cannot be i do except that i am in that position now and a part of me also thinks that every single soul on this planet can overcome an endogene depression non psychiatric for good everyone must find there own way but i feel how this mental state fades recently and it gives me instant panic because depressiontrauma has anyone also such a concrete feeling of being traumatised by the depression itself is there a way to deal with that to break that circle i have to add that i was a hypochondriac but psychoanalysis made it almost go away but i think it is focused now on the depression you all fee me no idea how to deal with that
1,i am 36 and stuck in years of misery depression is my self identity now and i do not know how to change it planet earth literally seems pointless and i do not know how billions of people can just live these meaningless lives i have had depression such a long time and i too feel like its too late to achieve anything meaningful with my life or even become the most basic description of what most people would consider a moderately successful adult i am 39 working this grocery store job that literally cannot advance anywhere and it barely covers the bills but it does enough for me to live on my own which i am grateful for that is a success i guess but i will be honest as well the job is fucking miserable all day customer service orientated for snobby rich healthobsessed and trendy people being stuck at this job its the best money i can find now literally makes me want to kill myself when i leave a shift there i have got a manager right now who hates me and if you know what constructive discharge means that is what seems to be happening at work so anyway i recently got hurt at work and typing at and using a computer at home like this is about the only thing i have been able to do for about two weeks now to interact with anyone i cannot drive very much while hurt like this so it really sucks like i can barely manage to make a trip to the store for some basic shit i need i have to get completely whacked on medication which can be fun if you like it but i do not like it when it is involuntary to try to do anything physical around the house like i had to do this one thing or i would get a fine and even then it is just so painful and hard to move it will probably be this way another couple weeks but maybe i can heal faster i do not know it seems like doctors where i am just will not prescribe pain medication anymore because there are too many people abusing it so now i cannot get some pain meds when i legit need them which just reminds me of another stupid aspect of our society failing i really do not see much point in my living at all when i am just going through the motions of life but i am miserable i can get by financially so far but i do not want to just get by while i feel shitty and useless and unable to advance myself i hate it and there is no point to living this way and there is several billion people living out this same lifestyle right now i do not know how so many people are ok with these pointless lives i guess they are happy enough with that i am not ok with it at all hurting my family is the only reason i am waiting or have not already gone through with it we do not get along so great right now but i would still never want to hurt them in that way i got to add just to be honest and inclusive that i have anxiety as bad as i have depression it is almost agoraphobic like it is actually becoming a fear of leaving my house for the million things that could go wrong being stuck here i am not happy but i guess i am safe i should not have to live like this no one should thanks
1,what are my best options out of this burnout hi guys pretty sure i have got burnout and i would live to know your thoughts on what is some options to get out of this hole i cannot even think straight so planning an exit route from this mess it is proving hard i will do a very brief overview of the situation male 39 3 months ago i was training for a ultra run i have been very active all my life energy has never been an issue during the training i started a new job after losing my previous job due to the pandemic it is been a massive step outside my comfort zone and i have been stressed almost daily for a few month now the problem started after i did the ultra run the week after i was tired as i expected but then it just kept getting worse and worse to the point i could not even walk up stairs fast forward 3 months i have not been able to do any exercise my sleep is a mess i have dry mouth all the time and i have got super bad brain fog i do not want to lose this job it is a serious career opportunity and could set me up for life and i do not think it would be that hard if my brain was working properly i should mention that i have had my blood tested by the doctor and there was nothing wrong i feel like i am stuck in a cycle where i need to relax but my work is keeping me in a stressed state so i cannot relax and that means that my burnout is never going to go away i do have holidays coming up i am just praying that my brain is going to reset itself but the same time i am seriously worried that if i am still knackered by the end of holiday which i think could be very possible then i am going to go back into a busy year of work and i am never going to break out of this cycle i have been living at home with my parents for the last year because i lost my previous job and i need to move out i am ready to buy house but i am really struggling with the extra pressure of even looking for a house with the way my brain is at the moment i know no job is worth giving yourself bad health but i do not actually think it is the job i think that something has gone wrong with my body and the job is not helping but i do not think necessarily that the job itself is what is caused this it is a combination of maybe overtraining for running combined with the stress of the lockdown and not seeing anyone for yearmy parents are isolating ending of a big relationship i had previous and the work pressure everything mixed into one somehow has just caused my body to to shut down the question how do i get out of this without losing my job i have been thinking maybe i need to go on medication to break the cycle of the stress so i can sleep better not be stressed every day at work and then my body will relax and reset i know antidepressants might be an option but i feel like they are just a double edge swordpatch and i will just have a bunch of problems later on down the line to deal with coming off them would love to know your thoughts on this situation maybe you have been there and found a way back to full energy thanks for your time
1,lifes just bland just ventingignore i came to this reddit to post about what is been on my mind but looking at other peoples posts it really puts into perspective how dumb my issues are when people are going through actual life changing shit somehow it makes me feel worse since i still feel like shit and i know i should not and i should just deal with it my issue is that i just feel like i do not have any real friends and what is worse is that i know its my own fault and mine alone i have probably 1015 friends at school and i know they all snap eachother and have their groupchats and hang out with eachother but when i was younger i was really busy with soccer and i never really got in to that now it just feels like its too late for me i feel like no one would even talk to me unless i talked to them first no one would notice i was missing for a day or a week at school and they certainly would not care i feel like my only value to them is that i am good in schoolhave answers and hw etc and i am good at soccer when school soccer comes around i used to have a best friend who i hung out with often i am really not sure what happened but we are not best friends anymore i do not think even the small things make me feel left out driving to events together sitting in cars hanging out before school and then stuff like hanging out just makes me feel unwanted no one ever invites me asks me where i am what i am up to i am just an afterthought maybe ill get remember maybe not does not matter to them apparently and its only made worse because i agree with them and i understand i do not bring anything to the friend group i am not real funny or nice or anything out of the norm that is not school or soccer i have been telling myself for a while i just have to get to collegecurrently a junior in hs and ill have a chance to start again be more social talk to more people but i realize now that is a lie its not just a switch i can flip i cannot just choose to be how all of my friends are i just never learned howmy own fault i am not depressed i do not think that is reserved for people with actual problems not stupid friend quarrels but life does not feel very good either i do not look forward to school anymore i do not want to see my friends only to feel even more left out when they talk about their plans together later that day as i stand next to them i am only happy when i am playing video games or on the soccer field in between that lifes just cold grey and mediocre if that is life then i am truly not sure that i want it why should i keep living with so little to look forward to especially when i cannot even man up and be more social on my own i sat in a parking lot today thinking about why i would want to live and i could not think of much that was for myself i guess ill just keep living cuz i am too scared to really do it and for my family my life is just a melancholy thing my one childhood is blown ill never have what they had and that is just an incredibly depressing idea for me also fuck you
1,does depression make you want to breakup my 29f bf 29m has been going on and off about breaking up with me since the last year we have been in a eight year long relationship he was seeking help for depression 34 years ago but he never completed treatment because he started feeling better soon one year ago we hit a rough patch with him doubting things in our relationship and that i did not love him cheated on him because i was not fully honest with him regarding some things which i have apologised for but i never cheated on him he quit his job at the same time and started freelancing for a while only to resume work two months ago in july 2021 before starting this job he did seek professional help not on my insistence but because he said he needed help with sleep he was on lexapro and another medicine for 23 months before he ghosted his psychiatrist saying that the doctor was just ripping him off he has faced major setbacks in his friendships over the last one year he doubts most of his friends and doubts their intentions does not feel happy in general the reason why i think he is depressed is i cannot recall a time when he was genuinely happy about anything maybe apart from when he got this new job but it soon turned into a stressful situation since this is not fulltime employment yet and his performance will be evaluated after he completes 3 months earlier when he would break up with me he would come back every other week saying he does love me and cannot live without me and used to apologise for his behaviour since the past few months his stance has become i never loved you i was wrong to be with you for eight years i am sorry i did not say this earlier even if i did love you i do not now you must move on i will too we still meet each other on the weekends at times i am helping him out with his gradschool applications building resume sops lors essays and we still do talk on a regular basis it is just that he will be awfully moody one day and then get started with his you should move on i do not love you talk i am trying to understand which part is true his depression or his words i have told him for now that we are broken up but the conversation on moving on is something we can have when he is feeling like himself our friends also point out his approach of painting everything in black if anything remotely grey is associated with a thing and they do call him out at times but his recent more fierce stance on saying how he does not love me and never did makes me wonder if i am the one just living in my own thoughts and things were not what i think they were we have spent 8 years together and had every intention of building a future together which even he has talked about at times on multiple occasions in the last one year i am ready to hold on if it is just his depression talking i have loved him enough to know i can continue for some more time but i am just not sure if i am right anymore
1,am i 28f actually depressed i often have to think about how meaningless existence is about how we are all going to die and there is no escape from it how the universe and everything we know is going to end and all that is is actually ephemeral and vain these thoughts haunt me to the point of getting really anxious i try to tell myself that it does not matter and what matters is enjoying the limited time we all have here on earth but then i look around think about global warming endless wars and struggle to find meaning in a meaningless world and i just cannot be happy my whole life i have been looking for something more than just average normal life but then i think we all are looking for the more but the more never comes people who are not depressed are just people who realize it first and adapt to the nothingness of everyday i do not want to adapt i do not want to burn out i keep on telling myself that what really matters in my life and what makes me different from others is that i have a passion i have visions i have true feelings i have a flame that keeps me alive but also that makes me desperate for something greater than life itself but there is nothing greater and everything leaves me feeling dissatisfied i still fight because otherwise it just would not make sense for me i work a lot because i want to be one of the best in my field i create a lot because i want to be successful as an artist i exercise a lot because i want to be the one with the best body i read a lot of books because i want to be the smartest person in every room i debate people because i want to show everyone that i have ides and opinions i spend hours preparing before going somewhere because i want to be the best looking one everywhere i go being avereage is simply a waste of existence for me whenever i work on myself get productive creative set goals my depression gets a tiny bit better after all it always comes back but that makes me even more drown to be productive and competetive in the end of the day when everything is quiet and i am at home with partner and he tells me that he loves me i realize that i do not feel anything much and the thirst for the more becomes almost unbearable i cannot calm myself i often have to use alcohol to get rid of anxiety over dying and feeling endlesly bored and empty then i need to escape the real world and get lost in my imagination about life that i could have had in a different reality i can stare at the wall for hours imaging a different kind of life for myself the thing is no matter how hard i try to get it i never feel good about myself or anything really i am at that point where i think having children is an act of horror existence is a painfuldissatisfyingtorture and i would never put another being through the hell of human life at the same time i know that all i have to do is keep trying and working and even harder and harder and harder to become the perfect version of the perfect me
1,not sure how to keep going lately i am so depressed and i have times where i cannot feel any happiness about anything i cannot feel hope i want to die sometimes but really i cannot because who would take care of my pets i cannot let them down that way but going on feels so bleak and it is hard the biggest issue at the moment is my boyfriend and i when we started dating we both had sex with other people and we were both fine with that i guess you would call us swingers the people i had sex with did not get along with my boyfriend they started avoided me and i did not get almost any sex anymore while my boyfriend still did this upset me i felt like it was unfair my boyfriend pointed out he is not the easiest to get along with and he warned me this might happen when we started dating finally i said i wanted to close our relationship because it did not feel fair anymore now there is a ton of resentment on both sides because we both feel like the other ruined what we had i do not know anymore all i know is the closeness is not the same i feel like crap my body image is terrible because all these guys used to love having sex with me and then all the sudden no one wanted to anymore my self esteem is rock bottom i keep second guessing was it wrong of me to close the relationship but i know i was miserable before thing is i am still miserable now this is all exacerbated because a lot of my friends were couples who i had sex with then when all this happened those friendships dissolved and i moved to live with my boyfriend a year ago when i lost my parents so most of my non lifestyle swinging is often referred to as the lifestyle friendships broke off in the move so now i have no friends also during covid about a year ago i lost both my mom and dad it was very hard on me he lost his brother 3 months ago in car accident he lived with us when he died and i was the one who answered the door when the police came to tell us it was very hard on both of us but of course more so on him i have no family left i feel so alone in this house with my boyfriend who i do not feel close to anymore sometimes i feel like he ruined my life because before we met i had a good life and was happy i think he feels the same way sometimes too i do not even know which of us is right anymore all i know is everything is dark i have no connection anymore with anyone nothing is fun anymore i cannot afford therapy i earn decent money but the way the us health system works it would still be hundreds of dollars a month even with insurance anyone have any actually helpful things to say i feel trapped in a box with no way out even dying is not the answer i do not want to do that to my pets i do not think my boyfriend would keep them if i died i never feel like doing anything i just feel empty i have no connection to anything please help me feel like life is worth living again that is probably a lot to ask i do not know anymore

1,i was 30 pounds overweight overly stressed and my body was responding in the forms of chronic pain and nausea i was coming apart at the seams and was on my own way to the emergency room life lessons from the flight attendant tools i use for my selfcare be sure to adjust your own mask before helping others says the average flight attendant we have heard this phrase a dozen times but we feel so weird about the thought of putting ourselves first before our loved one or child why does this feel so selfish and wrong culturally we are expected to be strong and almighty at all times we say things like i will sleep when i am dead or i cannot slow down because my work will not get done unfortunately we have all felt this way at one point in our lives some of us even feel this all the time let me tell you my story of how i had no choice but to put myself first it all started with these 6 words you have hodgkins lymphomastage four my husband got diagnosed with cancer in december of 2017 at the age of 27 our typical conversations about paying bills and doing laundry seemed insignificant it did not feel real while all hope was not lost intense stress tears and fear of the unknown filled our lives i was 30 pounds overweight overly stressed and my body was responding in the forms of chronic pain and nausea i was coming apart at the seams and was on my own way to the emergency room however as a mom of an energetic fouryearold i did not have the option to fall apart my little girl could not have both of her parents terminally ill in the hospital this was the beginning of my personal healing story i wanted my life and body back so i took control by putting myself first i began by putting a higher priority on selfcare by fulfilling my nutrition exercise and spiritual needs and i continue to do this to this day what would putting yourself first mean for you would it be that you finally have a reason and gain the perseverance to put your selfcare priorities above all others would it mean that you would use nutrition and exercise to fit into that outfit for the wedding you were invited to would it mean that you could take the stressful guesswork out of your healthy meal planning by having a system in place for dinner on those busy nights full of afterschool activities again this idea of putting yourself first is not new think back to the mundane instructions from the flight attendant my challenge for you find one way to put yourself first this week and do not feel guilty about it schedule a 1520 minute guided meditation session for yourself check this one out on soundcloud i also use the app insight timer for some amazing free meditations or tell your spouse to watch the kids for an evening and schedule a one hour massage at a local spa this is my favorite or be rebellious and take a day off work to stay at home and recharge busy yet balanced
1,i just went from not leaving my room for 3 years with the biggest fear of going outside to wanting to solo travel again in 3 days hi i am 21m and before this friday morning i had never traveled before in my entire life without my parents no friends sitting in my room being depressed and lonely about how i am getting further and further behind in life still do but i have improved myself so much in these 3 days i have eaten out for the first time like at a resturant i been going to places i did not thought i could find i have managed to use the citys train to travel did not think i could do that i have gotten thoughts to want to take pics on the places here like the view but i have gotten thoughts saying it will look dumb but i have done it every time anyway i have been open to meet up with people but i have not found anyone and i have been giggling the entire time being here because it is so pretty and i just feel so free i lived in my own hotel room like wow to me it is just wow i been continually saying to myself on my room wow just wow wow and freaked out because i cannot believe i am just doing this without little to any anxiety like hello i ordered room service to eat even though i had anxiety about it of what he would think of me because i am alone in my room but after going outside for 3h i needed a social break to get back the energy to go out self love right now i am at my hotel room and tomorrow i just got to eat breakfast and then i go home by train by the way i never traveled this far traveled at all rather without my parents and i traveled alone because i have no friends the clock is currently 9pm i could go out and go to a club because i never been to a club but that feels too intimidating for me at this time i do not want to operate in the night time with not knowing the streets etc i am taking care of myself this is more progress i have done in a fridaysunday trip then i have done in 3 years sitting on my room and only operating in my small city i am so proud of myself feels lonely though so i kind of want to cry i am imaging how awesome this trip would have been even more awesome if i had a friend or ultimately a boyfriend with me i am gay i am so proud of myself i want to cry right now because i am going home tomorrowi thought i would never say this but i cannot wait to travel again preferably with someone this time i know this sounds cringe and i cannot believe i have done this i am so confused why i do not have panic attacks and stuff but if i can do it you can do it too it really is not that scary when you have small missions all the time to think about i got to go to x to eat and i got to go see y and i got to go check what train i am taking for tomorrow etc these small missions keeping me busy i know that when i get home tomorrow it is back to normal and misery waiting for me but this was i going to say it super fun i have not had this much fun in sooo many years i feel alive anton
1,43 and completely lost i have never posted anything online before so i will try to be succinct i am 43 male never married no kids on medical leave from my job for depression i am so disappointed in the person i have become no matter how much i read or do it is like i have not gained any wisdom on managing lifes challenges i grew up in a loving home with lots of encouragement and high expectations i was an a student through college but my social skills have always been lacking i managed to work for the past 20 years but i could not keep up in my current job hence the medical leave i have been in therapy for much of the past 10 years my psychologist believes i have traits of avoidant personality disorder i take several antidepressants and i am currently two weeks into tms therapy nothing seems to help i am unbelievably critical of myself even now as i write this message i am certain that this will be the worst written message ever on reddit i have been reading hundreds of other posts and they seem so well written i am even more amazed by the responses how are you all able to find the words to share your wisdom and advice i read everything i can find on overcoming depression and avoiding suicide but it goes right through me and outv the other end with nothing retained i cannot imagine giving advice to someone there is so little i can think of to say to people in distress i am a mess right now i have lost hope of getting better i do not exercise i sleep 14 hours a day i have a house but i spend most nights at my parents nothing traumatic has ever really happened to me the worst thing is that my exgirlfriend cheated on me three years ago and i have not dated since i have some solid friends that i have known since high school they are all very well adjusted and have careers and families of their own i cannot seem to learn anything these days i used to be smart but i am not longer able to learn new things i cannot imagine surviving another 40 years i think about volunteering but i even tell myself that i have nothing valuable to offer i have no real skills to rely on i have saved about 300k in my 20 years of work i had saved that money so that i could support having a family some day i no longer think i am capable of having a family too overwhelming i would be an awful spouse and father i do not plan to go back to work i plan to just live on my savings as long as i can and then end my life by then my parents will be gone and i will not hurt them my siblings and friends will be hurt in the nearterm but they will be ok in the long run i have read so much on coping with this disease but so little spurs me to action until last year i am was microdosing with weed every morning to get myself going keeping up with job and social occasions the weed stopped working for me though now if i smoke it gives me some paranoia that makes things worse thanks for reading all this i love you

1,urgent 247 head pressure and awful brain fog symptoms 247 head pressure in the top back of my head and over my ears to the back awful brain fog where i can barely drive or go in stores or do much of anything i feel like i am in a dream like state to an extent where everything is in a fog and it is like i am not really present i believe this is called dissociation i also have blurry vision and just overall feel very off i cannot remember the last time i felt truly energized and overall just well this is going to be a long post but i greatly appreciate whoever contributes in october of last year i got extremely stressed i moved to california and got an apartment 2 weeks before covid hit in march and immediately everything was shut down buildings were boarded up i was okay most of the year until i lost my job and started freaking out about how i am going to pay rent etc also my wisdom teeth started causing problems and i needed to get them removed once i found out the price for this i did not have insurance yet it caused severe stress it seemed like everything from lack of job lack of money lack of social life lack of interaction was just taking over with physical symptoms of stress and anxiety i have had nights where i wake up gasping for air as if i am not breathing i have had many days where i cannot even walk or do activity because i feel so faint i have spoke to 2 psychiatrists about this and explained how my symptoms have been 247 for now 7 months and they both said they have not heard of stress and anxiety being a constant for that long without a break i have tried lexapro for a month and a half at 10 mg which i know is a low dose and it had no effect i have went to every specialist from ent neurologist emergency room twice eye doctor neuro ophthalmologist allergist and gotten every scan imaginable from mri to mra to mrv to ct to angiogram and everything is always normal these symptoms have pretty much debilitated me from living my life in any way which has then let to depression from having no life it is got to the point where just going to a new doctor appointment would make me feel extremely anxious and faint because i feel like it is just an ongoing series where i go to the doctor and they do not help and i repeat for months everything is just centered around the stress and anxiety of what could be causing this and doctors having no idea every single day i search my symptoms and constantly am online looking into this it is pretty much all i do what is throwing me off is the 2 psychiatrist saying these symptoms cannot be constant because i have seen other posts online saying otherwise the last psychiatrist said i can try zoloft i would appreciate if anyone can comment having dealt with similar symptoms and letting me know if zoloft or any ssri helped i know getting off the computer and outside more can be very helpful thanks for any feedback
1,how i learned to control my migraines hey guys i thought i would share my story of dealing with migraines i used to start getting them for what i thought was absolutely no reason i was always an anxious person but when i started my first job after college i started getting these stress migraines and they were debilitating i would come home from work and just lie down for hours until i fell asleep only to wake up with the pain the next day the underlying because was stress and i would experience other bodily manifestations of my stress such as bloating excessive sweating and sleep issues as you can imagine my body was a wreck while i still experience these feelings from time to time i have them significantly more under control and rarely get these uncomfortable feelings here is how i was able to take care of them first and foremost while i did meditate and it did help i realized the underlying because was that i was not focusing on the task in front of me and was instead trying to multitask when you try and multitask you because anxiety anxiety is being here but wanting to be there this would take a toll on my mental energy once i stopped trying to multitask and focus only on the task at hand my migraines started to become less frequent meditation helps with this because you are asked to practice concentration next when i experienced these feelings i approached them with a sense of curiosity why was my body reacting this way instead of getting upset at our body like most of us do when we get these feelings i started listening to my body i realized that stress and anxiety are trying to tell me something these emotions are my ally as opposed to my enemy i came up with a great analogy as to why i was getting these migraines when you consistently put unhealthy food inside your body what happens you get a stomach ache when you consistently put unhealthy thoughts inside your mind you get a mindache or a migraine once i came up with that analogy i was more mindful of what thoughts i was letting inside of my mind you will be surprised with the kind of garbage you let inside of your mind that is what these feelings are telling you so becoming curious about them really helped by this point i was experiencing the physical manifestations of stress a lot less frequently but i was still experiencing them this brings me to my final point trust and believe in the process these will not disappear overnight however if you noticed changed up until now which i did i trusted the process and eventually i almost virtually eliminated them i hope that helps those of you who are suffering from stressrelated migraines i tried to keep this as short and digestible as possible so i left out a lot of detail but please comment or pm me if you want me to expand on anything further i know how much these suck so i am happy to help out further if i can
1,how to cope with never beeing alone well like the title says techniques on how to relax even when i am never alone a good year ago i needed to move and the intention was to temporarly move in with my parent to find a new place but then covid came and the prises of house skyrocketed with no end inside for now and on my own it is about impossible to buy one at the moment also a stressor so i am a bit stuck there i am an introvert and i really really need my time completely alone and at the start my parents went a weekend away went on holiday so i got my time alone once in a while and i could cope my dad had a heart attack in april and with that went my alone time he still needs a second treatment but that gets delayed time after time so they stay home and like every weekend when i am free friends and family visit i need my weekends to relax a bit and now they are the most stressfull days of the week because i need them to be one thing and they now are the opposite i got a couple of hobbies biggest one of which is woodworking i mostly do everything from my mind like calculating measurement etc and i need to concentration but whenever i start within minutes one of them comes by all interested and bla bla and puls me out of my concentration finally done within 15 minutes the second one comes and does the same and short my dad always starts helping as he is bored as hell but he does not have the energy so everything is very slow and blocks me from enjoying any of it also explaining every step gets old my hobby is normally my escape from reality and he makes it his and that stresses me out big time my escape became a stressor but how do i say to my dad please go and do something else as he cannot do much at the moment now i have 3 weeks of holiday first already gone and i mostly sit in my room making plans for what to build play video games and build lego sets as that is the only thing i can do without being interupted to muchthe what you want for diner i am going to the supermarket i need this will you get it for me can you help with want some thea etc so even then they make it very clear i am not alone my mom just does not get it she is an extravert and everyone should be like that is her opinion she is not going to change my dad i never had a problem with but since he is sick he has been a bit different understandably he needs an escape aswel and chooses whatever i am doing i m getting very cranky restless during the day annoyed just stressed out in the last 2 weeks of my holiday i really need a way to calm down and to relax as if i start working again with this mindset i go nuts sorry for the rant but any techniques ideas food suplements whatever that can calm me down short term are very welcome long term my dad will have his second treatment and they will go out again and i will find my own place again

1,i 21f have no idea how bad it is i do not know if what i am feeling is valid or just making a mountain out of many molehills but i just want to vent about it i feel like there is this big grey cloud covering all of my emotions and thoughts cluttering everything up when i lay in bed and stare at the ceiling everything feels bad and scary and like i am going to fail in everything i like to envision it as a big ball of yarn that i slowly pluck and with every stressor i can name a little bit of yarn comes loose my parents college add my inability to start things finish things or really do anything and many other things i cannot quite put my finger on i do not know if this is the right sub to let everything out it may even span multiple subs i do not know maybe in the future i will make a complete post detailing why i think i am stressed but really it boils down to this college is going okay i am in an internship i feel i am doing an inadequate amount of work and i feel so scared that there are so many hours i have spend doing nothing because of my inability to focus and probably depression but depression has not been diagnosed my inability to focus comes from add it has been diagnosed late in high school when i was still a minor and although i was open to it my parents did not want to send me to therapy because they like to pretend nothing is wrong with me my parents may not belong in justnofamily just yet but they are getting close they do not understand me and have admitted to that they do not want to help me with my add and have made no move to understand it better they literally forgot they do not even know what it is or what it means they do not let me have any boundaries even now at 21 they do not treat me like an adult while they expect adult behavior and responsibilities from me i feel helpless simple questions from family set me right on edge the thought that there are two months left in the internship send me right into panick mode i cannot relax because my parents expect me to do homework and when i do not have homework they expect me to work ahead i do not do that i try to play games or draw or anything to relax but i am so focused on not getting caught i do not find joy in it on top of that i feel that i simply do not get enough out of my free time to really justify not doing homework my girlfriend has been my rock my wakeup call my stress relief but she has her own college problems and i do not see her as often as i would like not by distance but simply because of the fact that i directly go home after i am done at the internship she cannot help me any more than she already has so what should i do are there any methods of relieving stress right now without turning to a therapist what are the best ways to try and talk to my parents about eventually seeing a therapist
1,help me with what new throwaway i guess some background i am a young adult have had lifelong diagnosed depression along with diagnosed anxiety and two past psychotic episodes one being due to unspecified worsening depression and one being er psychosis no legitimate suicide attempts only recurrent si i do not even really know what to say except my life is beautiful and i am so ugly cannot even laugh without smoking weed these days and now that i have not been able to smoke for a week or so due to pending responsibility i am feeling peculiarly dead inside all i feel on the daily basis is pain from chemo meds anger from nowhere and the familiar lukewarm void that is walking depression my sleep and mental health have been in a downward spiral due to an overnight trip i took recently and it is causing my chronic pain to flare up over this summer i have degenerated into a slow and unintelligent version of myself i have been so angry about well everything i get angry at any videogame with the slightest hint of a competitive aspect i get angry at the love of my life over trivial things and i get angry at myself for being useless depressed and unemployed for several months now when i am not angry i become lachrymose and apathetic while the icy waves of nothing numb me to the bone and the prickly sand turns my flesh to ash today i had what is usually a great day i spent time with my boyfriend normally cuddling gaming and watching the television turn my worst days to gold however i felt nothing the few good moments he wrenched out of my corpse were quickly consumed up by the little black hole inside my brains labyrinth today my soul became an arid desert drought of tears god what i would not give to cry i would rather cry than cum or savor soft warm food when he dropped me off at my house i did not know what to feel if anything at all came i ambled toward my parents house and calmly watched a frog from the nearby lake jumping across our driveway as herds of others do in this season the nothing i felt twisted into anger over halfhearted drama from a message thread with some now exfriends i kicked the frog with quite a substantial portion of my bleak energy i stepped on it and kicked it into the wall of the house i just craved any kind of emotion which i so thirstily received i felt a tiny spark of guilt because i normally adore small insects and animals i almost even she would a tear however the nothing arrived shortly after so now i lie in my bed at the bottom of my own personal ocean typing a post to strangers for what i do not know what is wrong with me i need help but nobody on the internet is going to fix me and make it all go away i do not even know what the point of typing this was other than some stupid new level of attentionseeking well fuck it all and have a goodnight if you read this far
1,handling my family i am a fifteen yr old male and my older brother 20yr was recently diagnosed with autism he is high functioning but has a lot of social issues i have had to rearrange my entire life to cater to his needs now and it is difficult and for some reason whenever we argue like all siblings do or i argue with my mom they always make me out to be the villain in every situation here is an example we have recently decided to rewatch the entire mci timeline of movies because we enjoy them almost every five minutes my brother will point out very minuscule details at first i had no problem with it but when we got to the iron man movies it went from five minutes to every ten seconds constantly ohhh that is that iron man suit number or is it the other oneohhhh let me check and is constantly talking all the other small details that do not really matter at the moment because we are just trying to watch a movie and he is just rambling so i pause the movie and ask him to stop he says and ok and then just keeps going this happens around to more times before i snap telling him to just be quiet and watch the movie and then my mother stepped in here is context earlier when we were watching a different mcu movie my mother was very confused about the plotstory so i said hey mom can you put down your phone for this scene it explains everything she nods and watches the rest of the movie joyfully and laughing now let us get back to when she stepped in between me and my brother later she agrees that he needs to settle down but then i am immediately bombarded with her trying to make me the villain and then asks what is so important that you are looking at you are phone during the movie in a sarcastic and i replied just looking at my phone why are you mad at me about it you did it earlier and then she snapped now defending my brother in previous arguments she tends to be very minuscule with details and i always have a retort because most of the time she is just angry and does not know what she is talking about and then flips the fact that i rebutted into me being the bad guy in every situation it gets worse because she is a hypocrite about it when i get annoyed and snappy and go down to the same amount of detail that she uses when she argues she gets mad at me except when she is the one doing the nit picking and using the small details in her mind it is somehow justified and i should not be annoyed at her it seems like a mental trap that i am always the villain in these situations any advice on how to handle this stress i need it edit now that i have left the room because my mother did not feel like continuing the movie because i somehow ruined it she said she was going to sleep that was a lie because she is now joyfully chatting with my brother i almost feel like my family is happier without me maybe i am the problem
1,my family is holding me back and making my life hell and its ruining my job and health a bit of background my sister struggles with mental illness to the extreme we are talking cops at our door constant trips to the hospital alternate schooling and the whole lot she needs 247 supervision and we have to have everything locked away out of her reach at all times i currently live with both my mom and my sister and needless to say its very overwhelming dealing with her me and my mom have a hard time keeping it together and my mom will often turn on me due to stress and since i have no outlet it makes going to work near impossible because i just sit and get angry about what is going on at home now suddenly our landlord turned around and sold the house we have lived there for over 13 years been good tenants and always paid rent on time he gave us no written notice and has made our life a living hell its all super illegal but that is a completely different story we have 2 months to leave our original plan was to get a 3bdrm and split it but due to high housing prices we live in a big city and landlords are ridiculous here super scummy they try to charge for many illegal things even asking hundreds of dollars just to fill out and submit an application even then its not a guarantee and half the places are bug infested and in the centre of crackhead central i have suggested to her that she finds a cheap 2 bedroom in the city for the time being with my sister she needs to stay in the city or my sister loses all her support workers schooling and the lot its a 2 year waiting list minimum to get back in a program even if we provide transportation because the city will no longer cover it i drive and work fulltime i can go where ever i want my mother however does not drive and is currently laid off due to covid i do not want to deal with them anymore the constant violent out bursts the screaming and crying everyone at my work thinks i am crazy because i am always crying or throwing up from stress i had to go on stress leave before this because the physical effects from stress was making it impossible and dangerous to work the dizzyness and vomiting and the whole lot now when i suggested going our seperate ways to my mom i offered to help her in any way she would need including money and transportation to whatever extent i could spare it ended with her screaming and crying that i was abandoning her this makes me feel terrible but also makes me lean towards leaving even more what route do i take i know moneys already very tight for her and i love her but living like this day to day is literally killing me and i want to grow as a person and live my life tldr my family struggles with mental health and i have the option to leave for my own sanity but it means abandoning them in their time of need
1,back in the fog again did not think i would be back here again as i thought things in my life were suddenly looking up i am currently a semiprofessional athlete who is looking to make it fulltime its been my dream for a very long time and to people on the outside it looking that way however due to injury plus the pandemic i have effectively missed two years of playing i am 26m and i feel like i have put in a lot of time and effort for very little return it makes me feel as though i have wasted a lot of time focussing on this one thing and seriously brings me down coupled with that i have been battling serious anxiety issues since i was in primary school i worry loads about the future and struggle to think far ahead i have pursued sports relentlessly as it was the only thing that gave me pure joy and what i thought i was good at also making it would provide significant financial reward seeing friends on social media excel in their respective careers and enjoy life has made me feel as though i have wasted a lot of time and adds to my depression it also makes me feel as though i am not as worth much to people because i am not doing big thing so i am not good enough to be around them and more importantly i am not worth much to myself since i was young i have never really had people think i could amount to much aside from my mum of whom i extremely want to make proud but overall it has hugely imlacted my mental health to points where i doubt myself and end up asking myself if i have even learnt anything during my time of living i also feel as though since we are now slowly coming out of the pandemic life as gotten better for most which is good but somehow worse for me which may be naive to think but it appears to be that way to the point whereby i struggle to have simple conversations with people i do not find things as funny anymore and my attention to detail on things has gone out the window i even feel when writing this message i am not articulating myself the best as my brain is in a fog at the moment doing things such as getting out of bed is becoming an issue but i feel bad each time if i am wasting time i am struggling to make sense with reality and it is becoming very overwhelming i do not have money to see a therapist as i quit my job in sales due to the stress it was bringing and the way it was affecting my performance in sport overall i have some how wound up in another depressive episode and it seems to be the worst i thought i was mentally becoming more resilient after okay for a good amount of time but i just feel lost and confused and it is all happening at a time when things should be going well for people who have experience dealing with this or can relate to this situation in any type of way what did you do to cope with it and change your lives for the better and permanent

1,i feel life is just one big cycle of nonsense i am 16 right now stopped going to school a year ago so started working 2 months ago when i was 13 i realized that after graduating college its just eat work sleep occasionally going out with friendsfamily cycle do not know why i thought of it at the time but ever since it crossed my mind i just lost will to live i am not trying to say my parents is the because but due to family problem every 2 or 3 years we move country to country my mother is from philippines and father is japan because of it i never really learned to make friends so i tend to be alone so i just focused on studying and thinking for my future until one day it crossed my mind from that day i gradually lost focus on studying and ended up not going to school regularly until i stopped waking for school at the time i was thinking how should i die i lived in a 5 story apartment so at 11pm i went to the top preparing to jump but was scared of surviving it so i was thinking of how should i jump until my aunt showed up since we talked about suicide few weeks earlier and its really late for my reason of i want brethe fresh air father and mother was working at japan at the time so my mothers sister was taking care of me of course my parents knew we talked about suicide but they just thought i making a reason so i could skip school to be fair i was really lazy and obviously hated studying after thinking about it after that i had really long talk with my parents at first they are expectedly angry but i can see that they really care for me so i promised that i will not do it again this happened at the start of 2020 we moved to japan this may but now i do not think i can keep that promise now since i do not go to school and i am not planning to so i said i will work now at first they were against it since i did not do much for 2years and my body is kind of weak also corona but it was better than me not doing anything and ovethinking again to be honest i do not know why i am so scared of that idea it maybe my made up reason for my laziness so i hope i did not waste 2 years for my laziness now i just feel envy everytime i see a senior high because they were my classmate or same school 3 years ago and they have better future than me at the end i do not hate my parents just really bad events family of mother side was really messy i did not have confidence to talk at young age i was comfortable speaking with others but did not know how to initiate bit of bullying in japan since i am half on bright side i have income of 11001300 per month at 16 so not everything is bad but still i am scared i get bored and commit suicide wasted 1 hour of writing since laggy phone i have work tomorrow and its 10 30pm thanks for reading my vent
1,acknowledge the building stressors in your life as you age there will be more and more stress learn about this before it is too late i am in my early 30s i just had a birthday of a significant number to me i had a crisis i am still recovering from it life is getting more and more and more stressful i have had the same job for 6 years and it is increasing too and my workload is starting to get to me i have lost the ability to relax so it is hard to distract myself in the evenings we recently moved into a bigger house with roommates so there is more responsibility there you might notice that your functioning breaks down it becomes harder to do things that were once mindless and ordinary might even be hard to eat that is burn out it is a terrible place to be and it just gets worse if you have a mental disorder like me then stress will hit you harder i am working to collect all of them is what i joke to my friends in a maybei ambeingserious kind of way if you have a mental disorder like me it will be hard to regulate stress your mind wants to go at its own pace and there is a pace forced upon you that your mind does not like to follow but in order to survive you must follow it you need to find your own pace and go at that pace as much as freaking possible i have realized on that birthday mentioned above that it is damn hard to rediscover your own pace when you have become so used to existing in overwhelming stress we become zombies on autopilot to prevent stress from affecting us at every moment we lose connection with life existing merely as creatures of survival this can change but it is also very hard therapy helps medication can help routine helps create whatever patterns you can that reinstill a passion for life patterns and routines make you feel in control you are in control but control is hard to work up to i am working up to it i feel weak but i am so damn strong for making it this far and so are you so do not let stress win find your pace instill a peace in routine slowly work your way up that mountain like a mountain climber with no gearand find resting points where you can release your hold and simply rest stop and take deep breaths randomly throughout the day break the fourth wall and look around you and realize you are in life in that very moment the destination is not that thing you are doing this evening or this weekend but that very moment whether it is in a line at work in traffic talking to an annoying old acquaintance on the phone or whatever that is the moment some moments feel better than others but your mind is capable of making meaningful moments no matter what you are doing embrace that truth life can be worth it
1,i do not feel alive just passing the time i am 28 years old man having a 22 years old sister and parents in the family it is going to be the quite long post but i think it is important to mention everything my parents had an arrange marriage 30 years ago my father comes from a full fledged patriarchal mindset family when my mother delivered me via c section delivery my father kicked her in the abdomen because she wants to watch tv and my father wanted to sleep she had bleeding due to broken stitches but he manipulated my mother and my mother said to doctor that she fell down from stairs there is no evidence or proof of that incident but it happened everyone knows about this in my family but no one talks about it throughout their 30 years of marriage my mother has gone through a lot of mental trauma and abuse right now she is 52 years old and is suffering from high blood pressure anxiety hypertension and depression my father is still the same person and regularly tortures my mother last week he shouted at her she got so scared that her blood pressure shot up to 215120 she said she felt like that she would die that day it shattered my heart into pieces i want to help my mother but my mother still do not want to be vocal about the trauma she is going through and she had gone through she says that he is after all her husband and still thinks a lot about society and stigma i highly doubt if i seek any legal help she would change her statement which will obviously questions her testimony my father also knows how to take advantage of it and manipulates her for his own purposes she does everything unwillingly because she thinks that is she is supposed to do and other options are out of her way i have lost all the respect for my father and chances are i might hit him physically or punch him in the jaw if he would shout at my mother again right now i am staying in a hotel and could not sleep for 4 days my mother will die breaks my heart if this keeps going on my father has no shame or realisation of anything my sister lives in hostel and have not come to home since an year because she is also going through depression and anxiety i am also going through same issue and taking counselling i have started meditation also to keep my mind calm but one such incident triggers everything and it pushes my will to live life backward what should i do people say that my mother is also indirectly responsible for everything and if she does not want to leave him i should not worry myself and move on with my life but i cannot see her suffering i know she probably may not know what she is doing but all i know that she is going through something which she never deserves pls suggest
1,what the throwaway hear me out please i feel as if my life will never get better i just started college after a horrendous high school experience complete with bullying and exclusion college is not shaping up to be much better so far despite inspiring words by those around me and personal hopes i spend my days after class wandering around looking for people to hang out with i sometimes get a few snapchats for later contacts but they never really turn out to be anything i feel incredibly lonely and it is going on 5 years of this i do not know what to doi do not know if i can do it it is like god really wants me to eradicate myself i really want to find myself a group of friends that 110 enjoys me for who i am i want to find myself a girl that 110 enjoys me for who i am getting here to college has intensified a lot of things not just the loneliness all of the guys around me are rushing but since i am trans i do not feel comfortable doing so that makes me even more depressed because if i was not trans i would be able to do something like that i am at risk of getting the shit kicked out of me for trying to join a frat just because i am trans me being trans also makes things difficult finding a girlfriend i am 18 damn years old and have never had anything beyond a platonic hug kind of pathetic and i want to change that as soon as possible i am not ugly i am just trans and i do not think many girls in southern virginia want a trans dude i am really struggling to find a solution to the pain i am feeling i have been trying for actual years and i am reaching the end of my rope i am struggling to stay on top of school work and keeping myself healthy i do not have anything to motivate me to do so from my point of view my future is a repeated cycle of what i have already experienced shittiness i know life is anything but fair but what am i supposed to do continue living like this it just keeps getting harder i do not want to kill myself because something in the back of my mind says eventually things will get better and i will eventually be married to the love of my life in our farmhouse with our beautiful children but what am i supposed to do in the meantime i just want to drive and drive until i forget everything but i left my car at my parents to go to college i seriously do not know how long it will take to feel okay and i am tired of testing it i cried for the first time in at least a month a long time for me this morning because i woke up and the first thing on my mind is where are my friends wait i do not have any please give me advice on how to miraculously pull myself out of this i need to find myself a support group a girl and a purpose as soon as possible and i do not know where to start thanks
1,i was looking at this place for the last 20 min and i might as well share what is bothering me i do not think i am depressed i do not self diagnose with depression at points i think i am pathetic and making myself feel bad just because i am bored one moment i can be with a pillow over my face trying to science my crying the next i am thinking everything is okay and i am just being dramatic for context i am a guy in highschool i am bulgarian and my parents have been divorced for roughly half my life and a bit longer at this point that is all the info i am giving out for now this summer has probably been the worst one for me back in 2019 i was spending my 1st month of summer break watching anime and playing games after that my ex who i have known for 8 years more so knew as we are on bad terms now introduced me to a friend of hers and we started going out nearly daily out friend group slowly grew as we moved to highschool we are about 15 people at one point and that was probably the best time of my life in the coming months our friend group became smaller and smaller and by summer 2020 it was only 8 of us by october it was only 4 of us and by the end of october i was alone i went form having a ton of friends to basically having no one i got closer with one of the 4 people and we are now pretty good friends and helped me get a new friend group but even with a new friend group this summer i have not gone out with anyone since june the 30th i have not hung out with anyone barely anyone has texted me and i feel alone as shit i have just been gaming and watching anime thankfully i met my girlfriend back in may but she lives all the way in the usa so my hopes of ever meeting her are pretty low but she helps me to keep on moving on at points i really do hope that life will get better as i grow older but i feel like i will never be happy again as the current person i am i feel like i fucked up in this life and i envy anyone who has a nice friendgroup there was this one tiktok of 3 girls cosplay characters form chainsaw man and just hanging out it is unreal how jealous i felt of people who were having fun together i wish that when i am older i will be able to hang out with people i like and go places i wanted to go to with my gf but at the same time i have been crying nearly every night the last week thinking about how i am stuck in this country without anyone i am very sorry that this post is such a mess i just really needed to vent as i do not want to bother people who i game with and people that usually see the so called happy and positive side of me is there any advice that you would give me so that i could atleast be a little more hopeful of the future
1,my 3 month hiatus after a mental breakdown is about to end i have always been depressedanxious for as long as i can remember but this past year my mental health has been at a severe all time low i quit my really great job 3 months ago because i had a mental breakdown and literally felt like i was going crazy and could not handle anything at all i have always been work motivated and have never not had a job since i was a teenager i am 30 now the last 3 months have been incredibly difficult to say the least i have been seeing a therapist and i have tried 9 different antidepressantsantipsychotics in the last like 6 months nothing has helped i sleep most of the day every day i have not needed hospitization thankfully however my husband and i have definitely discussed the possibility of me needing to be admitted and there have been times that i was very close to going i have had to have him hide my propanolol i take as needed for panic attacksanxiety because i was suicidal and fantasizing about overdosing i just started trintellix in addition to lamictal about 2 weeks ago for the first week or two of taking most of the medications i have tried it has always seemed to help at least a little bit i am assuming that is just a placebo effect because i want it to help so badly but they always stop helping and i go back to my bedridden severely depressed self the last week or so i have actually felt better than i have in the last few months i am not 100 of course and i still have a hard time getting myself motivated to do shit but i actually feel like there is a possibility of me being able to get things done i feel like there is a 150 lb weight on top of me instead of a 200 lb weight on top of me i am really really scared it is not going to last like all the rest of the medications though long story short i finally got a job a good one that i am excited about i start in 20 days i am looking back at the last few months and looking at how i am feeling now i really really want to start this job while feeling at least okay i know that once the excitement of the job passes the depression will probably creep back up but i am hoping it will be at least manageable i do not want to fuck it up and have to stop working again i am trying to think of ways i can prepare mentally before i start what kind of habits i should try to start getting into ahead of time so i do not find myself too overwhelmed and unable to handle anything i have been so severely depressed the last 3 months and i am not going to be able to stay in bed all day when i start this job it is going to be exhausting if i do not make changes now anyone have any advice ideas encouragement thanks in advance red_heart
1,my therapist cried in a session and another therapist told me to quit her as soon as possible i have been seeing my therapist for a few years but just started recently feeling comfortable enough to open up about my past trauma to her upon doing so she cried she did try to hold it back but eventually she cried then immediately apologized and told me that i remind her of her daughter and she cares about me it honestly was the first time i have felt love from a parental figure however during that time i was actually having a mental breakdown i was reliving my trauma everyday and it impacted my work greatly my boss was not understanding and my physichiatrist eventually recommended a extensive therapy group with a great therapist this therapist was not at all what i expected she was incredibly into the tough love approach she made everyone go in a circle and talk about their most traumatic moments i have social anxiety and these were strangers so i did not really participate in that but i did talk about my therapy experience and my coping mechanisms and such she eventually found out that my therapist cried once in a session she told me that was beyond unprofessional and that i should drop her immediately i actually did end up dropping her only to get a horrible experience with another therapist one recommended by the therapist that told me to drop my initial therapist i was so sad and eventually went back to my initial therapist i have not seen anything wrong but i cannot get help but feel insecure about my own decision am i making the right choice is it okay to go to someone because they feel like a friend you can open up to are emotions bad and unprofessional for a therapist to express lil update wow thank you all so much for the comments and awards it was so nice to read all of your experiences i am so overwhelmed with happiness right now to not feel so alone i have seen 8 therapists in my life and i have never felt this comfortable with one it honestly was the first time i have not regretted telling a professional my personal trauma although not everyone agrees with this approach her emotion ultimately showed me that i have people that care about me and it really helped me in a time when i really just needed compassion with that being said i am continuing to see my empathetic therapist as that is what works best for me thank you again for all of your reassurance and encouragement in helping me choose what is best for me i struggle a lot with decision making so i was really in my head about this anywho just wanted to say you are part of a wonderful community here and i hope you all find happinesspeace i am not there quite yet but baby steps are okay
1,i am too lazy at this point to do anything that i should be doing hi darn it i was working on awesome projects like an antianxiety chatbot and stuff and an online indie game all was going well until about 4 and a half years ago when haters have been stalking me online documenting everything i do saving everything i post and putting it in a google drive folder and people extremely often messaging me with threats and mean messages like this and it keeps happening and they keep harassing my followers too so i feel like taking a break from my main account i already did before but the haters that cyberstalk me somehow found them all so i have already made like 10 email addresses and accounts already before i am running out of stamina and it is too noisy here so here is a list of things i got to do but i cannot get myself to do it because it is too much work for me nowadays make a new email account use that to make social media accounts where i game and vent about how noisy it is here i was doing that on my main account but the cyberstalker troll guys would backup everything i post and repost it on youtube without my permission and twist things around make another new email account use that to make social media accounts dedicated to well everything that i am a huge fanboy over make yet another new email account use that to make awesome gaming videos where i am not constantly venting about how i can not stand how freaking extremely noisy it is here at this apartment that i live at make another email account again use that to make a podcast with a female voice changing program and attempt to somehow redeem and defend myself my old main account with it not sure about this yet though that might be a bit too shady to do i do not know i do have a female side to me though i mean i am a femboy to be honest so make yet another email account use that to make videos where i can actually cuss if i feel frusterated i do not usually cuss and i like to keep my content family friendly so i would like to post videos where i play games and talk about subjects and things that tick me off where i actually cuss and i would like it to be seperate from my other main gaming account that my family would probably subscribe to so that i can cuss and have it for 17 people so that i can cuss in the videos without worrying much that i might be a bad influence to anybody ok but i do not want to do any of that i already made like 10 email accounts before and such i am getting really sick and tired of it i really want to do all of those things that i listed and i have been wanting to for awhile now but i do not want to make yet more accounts it is just soo tiring to me now
1,why am i so different to everybody else i am ed 18m studying mathematical physics at nottingham and i can do a lot of shit i am relatively academically intelligent have played the piano since i were 6 writeproduce my own music put my first solo project on spotify today i am about top 100 for duathlon sports in uk uniscolleges etc i have incredible loving yet divorced parents who are amazing and i really appreciate my stepparents are great and my stepbrother is one of my best friends on paper i am living the dream yet i just cannot find any sort of peace with myself i get overwhelmedstressed with too much social interaction and i am always critiquing myself my mums a counsellor and we just do not get along mindsetwise and she claims i have mild aspergers syndrome as a number of my friendsteachers have previously said this does not bother me because the result is irrespective of anything in my life but recently i am finding myself thinking about some deep dark shit although a lot of which i know i would never do i have been in this place before multiple times but this definitely feels different i have had some close calls before very serious car crash when i was 17 and a trip to hospital of an lsd trip gone majorly wrong i would love to say i care but it seems as if i have just given up on myself recently i want to be the best person i can but i have never successfully managed a friendship which has not gone wrong probably because of me and i have never been emotionally involved because i am so fucking insecure of everything to do with emotions i have never ever spoken about myself like to this anyone before let alone to the public i just do not understand it i appreciate this has been a very tedious message to read but i humbly assure you it was more painful to write the only reason i did was because i am currently avoiding my parents at all costs because i physically cannot have a conversation with anyone right now i am exhausted it is xmas day recently i have noticed the way my brain works is totally different to everyone else and it is unsettling knowing that none of my friends or family will understand who i am edit i am also developing a very minor drug problem i have been high everyday for the past few weeks because i cave in and give up with trying to sort stuff out whilst sober i sort of want to say merry christmas but i feel like i have just contradicted any sort of christmas spirit tldr nothing i ever do will fulfil me because i am a greedy cunt and i am struggling to find any qualities in myself despite what people say also might be autistic and i cannot deal with emotions whatsoever why am i so different
1,i just want to quit everything it is a long story but i will tell as shortly as possible i am gay so i worked very hard for my entire life to move to europe to study and live there after i finished my bachelor very successfully i got very ill nothing too serious but 4 separate illnesses piled up at the same time and this ruined me i had started a masters but i had to quit and move back in with my family in my country my country has mandatory military service being in the shape that i was and also being gay i was in no shape for military service so i started a masters in another field that i thought was easy the military service is postponed if you are studying i took care of my illnesses in the meantime except for my serious allergy problem whose treatment lasts approx 5 years i am still ongoing through that treatment i have arrived at the thesis state of my masters but gosh i just hate it so much i do not want to do it anymore it is so stressful and also so pointless that i just want to quit everything i simply do not want to do it and no force can make me want to because i am a very straightforward and authentic person if i do not want to truly do something i just cannot do it but if i quit i would have to go to military service and i am still going through treatment i could try getting an exemption by saying i am gay there is such a system in place but i am not sure if they would believe me and i am not sure what it indicates for my future i cannot get a postponement because of my treatment they do not listen to that even though the actual reality is that i am having breathing problems all day long that is the life i have to go through the only thing i could possibly do is to sign up to say that i am gay and funny thing is i have a 398 gpa so externally it does not make sense to quit but yet still i hate the program so much it makes every awaken moment of life feel like disaster i hate this i do not want to be in this situation and i do not want to live like this but yet i am tied up and cannot move on i can barely lift my head up anymore and i do not know what to do i guess i literally do not want to do anything i just want to quit everything that is all also i am extremely lonely i do not have any friends that want to see me and no one proper wants to date me either i was doing really fine in life and i knew the value of it too never took it for granted i was happy and i wanted to make other people happy too but my life got ruined i cannot solve any of this anymore and i feel like i am out of my mind i just do not want to do anything anymore i just want to quit thanks for listening any advice is appreciated
1,25 years old with absolutely no friends i am a 25yearold girl i will just get straight to the point i have no friends no boyfriend nothing somehow i was the popular girl in class i am doing masters and i was always surrounded by a huge group of friends all that changed this quarantine i began to see how much i was never really needed in these peoples lives it first hit me on my birthday the people i thought were close to me did not even bother doing a video call for me or even send anything on my birthday this was in stark contrast to another girls birthday in the group they all had a video call i was told to join made a loving video for her compilation of clips and pictures and had a small virtual party for her this really hurt me and over the next few months i saw them drifting more and more away now this has been the pattern for friends throughout my life my work friends and even school friends these all are people i was immensely close to at one point but now i am not in touch with anyone whenever i do try to strike up conversations they just humor me for a few minutes before ending the conversation or other times they are already close with each other as a group and i feel like an outsider another thing whenever i thought i was best friends with someone they instantly replaced me with someone bubblier more extroverted or more fun within months this has happened to me since my school days it hurt me a lot but i did not speak about it for fear of looking desperate or being ridiculed so i bottle it all in an incident that will be always etched in my mind is something that happened on my 22nd birthday my boyfriend at the time had broken up with me and i was all alone there was a girl who i naively thought was my best friend up until that time i ended up buying and taking a cake to her place in the hopes that we would celebrate my birthday or maybe she had something planned for me she did it for all her other friends when i got there she looked surprised and very very much like she pitied me she had not even remembered my birthday it is come to the point that legit the only people that truly care for me and have time for me are my parents that is it i do not know what i am trying to say with this post is there anyone out there who feels or experiences the same thing as me how do you deal with it edit i am literally crying my eyes out with the support that is pouring in and the stories you all are sharing i had no idea there are so many people who feel the same way as me i am at a loss for words seriously you guys are the best thank you for making me feel like i am not absolutely alone
1,i have been depressed since i was 13 and it is all because of my parents ever since i was a little kid my parents were always toxic and they have not really changed much i was never really allowed to have friends or get too close to anyone for the purpose that people are bad which i understand now that people are bad but i feel like the lost sheep and i cannot even socialize and i am 19 i have had depression and depersonalization and anxiety for as long as i can think of to this day i still do and this is no way of living i try to have a good relationship with my parents but then i remember all the past times and the feelings resurface they would always threaten me that if i had fights at school that they would kick me out but in reality people were the ones starting things with me i had no one to express myself to and my family only made fun of me and told me i was lying i told them i had a condition called trichotillomania and they denied it and said that i am lying i would fill in my eyebrows with makeup because i wanted to hide the spots from where i pulled my hair out in return i got made fun of and told that i look stupid instead of providing me with professional help of course when i have all these outbursts it is because i have lived my life in humiliation and grief and never did someone offer to help me through the darkest period of my life i feel like i have been living in hell they have bullied me so much in my life that i cannot even function like a mentally stable person and i cannot do anything about it because they buy me food and pay for my things so i will be seen as ungrateful and then i will be blamed again now i will not say that i have been a perfect child either but growing up i was surrounded by bad and abusive people so i became stubborn and sometimes got into trouble but i was only young and was expected to act like i know everything which is impossible and a good parent would be better at teaching their child but why expect your child to be perfect when your child lives around parents who fight all the damn time and hit each other but i cannot take it anymore and i cannot continue ignoring the fact that i have had a horrible past and it is the reason why my mental health is so bad i cannot even make it through the first month of college without wanting to give up because of how hard everything is and no one even fucking listens they all just have high expectations of you and not having self esteem or friends or confidence just makes everything worse should have just offed myself a long time ago because there is no recovery from this illness ever it is going to be a long road of misery

1,i sold my guns they originally belonged to my grandpa i am not a hunter but we used to go out target shooting and i was a pretty good marksman when he died he left me two of his old rifles they have mostly sat locked in my closet ever since worth a lot of money but unable to let go of them partly out of sentimentality but i would come to realize that i also felt compelled to keep them around for more troubling reasons my depression has been lifelong and i have had varying degrees of success fighting it recently things have been okay but i have had a nightmare of a time with intrusive thoughts impulses to do things i do not even want to do would pop in to my head at the worst times and i would fixate on the details of the aftermath until i would bring myself either to tears or to panic what if i just went up there and did it would my wife be better off in the long run would the friends i have not spoken to in years show up this is shit i do not need running through my mind two years ago i was feeling better i was finally getting serious about art and photography again i actually started selling prints and even had a little space in a local gallery for my work then the grey returned and i started seeing less and less worth going out to see then the darkness came back and i became convinced that those things i used to see and enjoy were gone now and nothing good was on the horizon so last week i made a decision packed up the guns all the ammo i had left and drove to the sporting goods store i got 2200 cash for the pair of guns and on the way home i stopped by best buy and bought myself a fujifilm xt3 for just around 2000 later that evening the intrusive thoughts returned as i tried to think about dinner what if i just went up there and then it cut off the pressure was gone went up there and what grabbed the camera i have always wanted and started taking pictures i did i cursed the cold bundled up grabbed my new gear and lost myself in the woods taking pictures of snowflakes and a family of deer that happened to wander though i have been shooting the camera for the last week and i cannot put it down i feel something i am really fucking good at this and i am motivated to do it my worst impulses have been stopped in their tracks and replaced by the desire to improve and surprise myself it is always going to be a struggle for me and i know that but i feel free in a way that i never really expected also posted in rgetting_over_it if it is not allowed to post in two subs let me know and i will delete
1,as my depression lifted the world seem to change around me i have a story that i would like to share i think it pretty accurately reflects how depression shaded my world and how that changed once i started to get better i have been lurking here a while and want to let people know that things can get better i had been in a rut for several years it got to the point where i could barely get out of bed i do not know exactly what changed but i decided that i had had enough and would do what i could to get better for me this took the form of quitting smoking i was up to a pack a day and going out for jogs i was in university at the time there was a lagoon on campus a small lake that was next to the ocean about 15 miles around i decided this would be a good place to try running laps i was awful out of shape could barely breathe and was only able to run for a few minutes at a time without my lungs and legs screaming to stop i was certain i must have looked awful and that everybody was judging me but i kept at it i noticed this woman out there walking laps she was an old woman with nasty hair sagging skin and she wore these horrible flipflops which revealed toe nails that definitely needed clipping what a hag i would think to myself why is she even out here as i started going out there regularly i saw her almost every day eventually i started to wave to her as i would pass the first few times she did not notice but eventually she would wave back then i started smiling and waving and she would smile and wave back it became a part of my routine to wave and smile at her while out on my runs she was working almost just as hard as i was getting out there every day i was getting close to graduation and this would be my last run around that lagoon so when i saw her that day i stopped and started to talk to her we introduced ourselves she told me that she had lost her husband a few months prior to a heart attack and that she was hoping to get into shape so that she could get healthier and live long enough to see her grandchildren grow up this interaction brought me to the brink of tears the woman looked nothing like when i first saw her she was smiling had a glow of positivity about her and even got herself some proper footwear as i got better the way i saw and interacted with the world also got better i imagine that this womans view of me as an overweight slob who could barely breathe trying to run might have improved as she got better too you are not alone things can get better
1,feel like i am at breaking point sometimes my whole life is a mess i am abused by my narcissist parents who i am also fulltime carer for which makes it all worse no i cannot leave or get other carers in please just accept that you do not know the whole situation thank you my sister married 2 kids never even offers to go grocery shopping she drives i do not for them and when i say to my parents they should ask for her help they do not want to bother her yet they fawn over how amazing and hard working she is i get called lazy cos i quit my job to scrounge government money using their disability as an excuse they do not refer to me as their daughter they call me their carer they treat me like a maid like staff yet when my sister does help it is with things my parents have refused to let me do so then they come round on sunday do the thing and i feel like it makes me look so lazy then when i make a point you said no when i offered to do that i feel petty some bg on my sister never got beaten by mom i did never left me alone with her kids i got to change one diaper when they were babies refused to teach me how to drive never calls me or invites me to her house gives me the general impression she does not want me around my mental health has never been great but lately i am just crumbling into a state of nonexistence i have no desire to shower brush my hair even change my clothes because of my mental health i forget all birthdays and events and never have the money to give them unless i go without food to do so they say it is fine but i get that look you know the look that oh here is the family fuck up again kind of look i drink daily not loads just every evening i drink low alcohol wine this brings on the binge eating which makes me feel sick sometimes i am sick due to care work i cannot take days off or breaks due to lack of support this is even less possible i am sorry this is all over the place i just do not know what to do i hate my life i hate myself and who i have become this is not me i used to be so happy life of the party i used to dress up and feel pretty i look so fat stressed and tired i loathe catching my reflection these days i just hate myself been to doctors twice different ones they do not give a shit one laughed at me the other said i do not ahve time for your life story and just shoved tablets under my nose offering me free counselling which does not work i need a therapist not someone to nod at me and ask how i feel about that
1,i do not want to do this anymore i am not a big reddit poster but what i have to say i would like at least a select people to hear it i do not know if i can help anybody but if it helps you to know people are going through the same thing i will tell you i am going through it i am a 26 yo male and used to be the happiest man without a problem in the world it all started when i was about 1617 years old i had chronic pain and severe kidney problems i went to multiple doctors searching for a cure or a procedure that would return me to normal none of the doctors i visited seemed very interested in fixing my issue as they did in just prescribing me narcotics i was pretty straight laced and at first was not even interested at all in taking these medications i just wanted my problems fixed however the doctors insisted and quite literally talked me into taking these medications that controlled me with script after script coming for the better part or 4 years here i sit now after 8 surgeries and probably close to 100 prescriptions for oxycodone vicodin dilaudid and yes even fentanyl wishing i would have just dealt with the pain and never given in to taking the narcotics even once addiction is such a real thing and it can happen to anyone i hate to say i am not at fault for this because i am sure some of the blame is on me but this cycle of addiction depression and suicidal thoughts and actions would likely not be there if it was not for me being given script after script and forcefed pills since i was a teenager now i buy drugs from the streets just to feel anything and i just wish more than anything that one day i can put this neverending cycle behind me i am sorry for the rant guys and thank you to anyone that takes the time to read this for reference this was in the us during probably 20122017 when so many doctors were getting in trouble with the law for over prescribing opioid medications we hear all over the news about what happens to these doctors and pharmacists but what about the likely hundreds of thousands of lives that were impacted by them getting patients hooked on pain killers forcing them to either go through constant depression pain and withdrawal symptoms which sometimes feel worse than death itself or going out and finding these drugs elsewhere and buying them for their own use this is what led to such a major opiate epidemic in the states and why so many have lost their lives to this painful and seemingly impossible to escape cycle again sorry for the rant i love you guys red_heart
1,today was my 21st birthday i turned 21 today i live in one of the biggest college towns in the country when you turn 21 here it is a big deal i just finished my third year of college and my third year of having absolutely no friends i am not the party type or anything but it still is a bummer not to have a single friend to share the occasion with today i received three texts more than most days one from my mom my dad and my cousin wishing me happy birthday in all fairness i do not have a facebook and i do not expect people to memorize by date of birth or anything but it still feels really sad not to hear back from anyone i guess i have never been comfortable with having a facebook the idea of being so interconnected which each others lives and making daily status updates is such a foreign concept to me but i think in not having a facebook i have sacrificed my social life absolutely anyways i have spent the entire day in my room with the lights off trying to drink away the depression of today and of college there is not a single person who if i called them right now they would pick up and talk to me i have been fighting with my parents and after a few shared unpleasantries are not answering my calls because they want we to cool off and understandably so i have been no contact for ever a year with my girlfriend i knew from highschool who i ended up dating long distance when we started college today i made an attempt to call her went to voicemail to ask her if she would let me take her out to lunch as friends to catch up but i have not heard from her it really breaks my heart that i lost that person who was my best friend for a good part of my life i assumed she would have remembered today was my birthday i certainly did not forget hers anyways if you have made it this far from the bottom of my heart thanks for listening to me vent edit the reddit community has been absolutely amazing you guys have been sending me happy birthday wishes from all corners of the globe i have been getting offers for people to buy me drinks and some have even given me their cell numbers to talktext me if i was still feeling down you guys are unbelievable you turned what was a miserable day for me into one of the most memorable birthdays i have ever had from the bottom of my heart thank you for all of you who took the time to help a stranger on the internet thank you your words of encouragement have lifted up my spirit exponentially i cannot say it enough thank you thank you thank you
1,people who are depressed should reach out to their friends tries to reach out nobody replies update so i thought it would only be fair to post this update while one friend still does not seem to give a fuck i am meeting another friend for lunch tomorrow turns out she is been having a thyroid flare up one other friend also wants to make lunch plans soon so we will see about that some people care but have stuff going on other people do not care pay more attention to the former original post seriously fuck everyone it is so easy to say after someone ends their life that they should have reached out to a friend and talked but who is really willing to listen only a select few of us are blessed with friends who listen with sympathy and respond in a timely way the rest of them are just faffers capitalism has rotten human relationships to the core and everything has become disposable including friendships hang on with dear life to those who really care about you and are willing to talk more often than not it is people who have struggled with mental illness themselves edit it is usually better to talk to a therapist if you can afford therapy that is about issues that friends do not have the professional training to deal with i do not recommend burdening other people with all your issues because that would just drive them away people have enough shit in their own lives to deal with however it sucks if you want to talk with a friend who clearly knows you are going through a tough time and they do not return your call edit 2 looking back at my post i realise i sound a little angry and cynical but i really wish for a culture where mentally ill people could get the nurturing and support they need a big part of that is also having access to mental health professionals who are capable and helpful if you can please seek the help of a therapist it has helped me realize where my boundaries with others lie and how i can strengthen my own self to ask of others what i needdeserve from them it can be a longdrawn process and you might not always land a good therapist at the first attempt but please persevere if you have the means thanks to everyone for your comments i am trying to reply to each one but it is hard to keep up so i am sorry if i miss yours rememberyou are worth the effort and the struggle so please hang in there edit 3 if you are in the us uk canada or aus you can use this directory to find a therapist near you read about them what insurance they take etc
1,casually suicidal do you ever look at yourself in the mirror and think about death you think about the consequences of it and what peoples views are on it maybe you have even considered suicide you brush it off most likely that is what most people do people are scared i am scared who would actually want to die though right this is what casually being suicidal is can you have suicidal thoughts and want to die at the same time i have a fear of death i always have always will how is it that some days i want everything to end but i do not at the same time it is my biggest fear but also my biggest relief my biggest wish in reality i just want the pain to stop why is everything so difficult sure you would tell me to go get therapy go get tested by a psychologist or something as if that advice means anything you want to label us as if everyone feels the same thing people like this are the same in some ways sure they are but most people do not want to die they want it to stop what exactly do they want to stop people people are predictable what other reasons are there for someone to want to go as far as think these awful thoughts even good people turn bad everyone is bad even me people tell you to talk to others about these feelings that it will help but only people who experience these kinds of thoughts would understand and even then it would give them this negative thing to relate to is that really a good thing to relate in wanting to die back to my point what can people do i cannot call myself depressed because i am not sad all the time i cannot say i have anxiety because i am not anxious all the time it goes on the point of this paragraph is to say do not tell people to ask for advice or say that you understand what they are going through i always tell people what i am going through they brush it off talking about it can help but only for the right people for people like me i do not exactly know if i have specific mental health to blame everything on i am just feeling like this that is all for all the comments i am sorry i cannot reply to them all but i will try to when i get round to it but i want to say this now for anyone who will be reading in the future please feel free to pm me i will always reply did not realise this would blow up but it is nice to know people feel the same way i hope you find some sort of comfort in that as i do stay safe someone shared this link with me if you want you can read it
1,my genitalia are destroyed after being raped and being prescribed lexapro i do not want to live anymore being raped and being on lexapro ruined my genitalia and it is ruining my state of mind please help hey you all not sure how to start this so i think i will just get into it at 1213 years old i f19 started feeling deep depression due to extreme bullying at school i started therapy and then lexapro at 17 my anxiety decreased but i now also had an extremely low sex drive plus genital numbness i decided that was better than daily panic attacks and constant depression so i took the pill regularly and properly when i was 18 i was unfortunately raped several times by my longterm boyfriend who i considered to be the love of my life what was left of a sex drive was now destroyed now matched with even deeper depression and incredibly incredibly low self worth regarding my body and my sex life not long after that i was diagnosed with spastic pelvic walls or an extreme form of vaginismus i have always been incredibly tight for a lack of better words not able to fit a tampon usually passing out from extreme panic and pain when i tried i am not able to have proper sex because of it the only time i have been penetrated was by my ex when he would rape me and that was the worst pain of my life physically and emotionally i am now 19 and i am in a happy committed relationship i love him deeply and he is a great partner however i find myself so depressed that i cannot provide for him sexually not only for his sake but for mine my entire genital region is broken and it makes me feel like less of a woman for it i understand that a working vagina or any vagina for that matter is not what makes a woman but it is the only way i can describe it since there is no proper term for female emasculation i have started wellbutrin and stopped lexapro around two weeks ago and i am very anxious to not see any improvement i also start pelvic floor therapy next month to help with my pelvis spasms i understand that it can take up to three months but i am looking for reassurance from others in the same boat i cannot keep doing this anymore i hate myself and body and suicide is constantly on my mind if anyone has dealt with this or something similar i would love to hear your advice thank you please do not tell me that sex is not that important i have had several people tell me it is okay to not have it in our lives but this is way deeper than that this is now a physical issue
1,nobody has ever shown romantic interest in me context i am a 20 year old college student with severe clinical depression and anxiety i have a decent amount of friends and we pretty regularly hang out and go out together my friends say i am not an unlikable person i have some hobbies including reading and writing i am told i am pretty funny and as far as i know my friends and family like having me around however i tend to be more on the introverted side and do not always take to people right away i also do not think i am necessarily ugly just not attractive i have a skinny build i am 510 etc etc i have gone through two whole decades of my life and not a single person has ever shown a romantic interest in me i have had and currently have plenty of friends who are girls and have never had an issue talking with them so it is not like i am someone who never puts themselves out there during quarantine a bunch of friends and i downloaded tinder as a way to talk to people around campus while we stayed shut in our apartmentshomes nothing really came of it but i quickly realized that i was not having the same experience as all my other friends they were getting tons of matches and likes and i was only getting a few likesmatches all the conversations i had with matches never seemed to go anywhere despite trying different approaches and even having my friends give me advice when i brought up my lack of likesmatches to my friends they tried overhauling my profile to be more like theirs but there was no change tonight a couple friends and i were hanging out and they were all swiping through tinder and getting matches while discussing their plans with some of these girls to hookuphangout obviously i had nothing to contribute to the conversation and just sat there scrolling through tinder while watching my friend next to me get 3 matches in a row i felt awful i am just so tired of it all i was not worried in high school about girlsrelationships as i figured i would have plenty of chances in college to pursue those things but i am coming to realize that people are just not interested in me i feel like i have tried everything and seeing my friends put no effort into any of it and still have so many girls coming to them makes me feel like just giving up i am scared because i feel that after i graduate it is only going to be that much harder to meet people i guess i am just wondering if anyone ishas been in the same boat and if anyone has any advice
1,always stressed about assignments please help so i am a college game development student who is just applied for uni and i have also had 3 different units to complete in the past 3 months i was stressed over my personal statement and my unis of choice and then even after sending the application i got stressed over getting a reference and other details there is also the fact my friend who i joined this course with said he will not be applying to uni so i will be all alone even if i do get in i am not good at being independent i applied two weeks ago and yet i constantly stress over the idea of failing to get into uni just for small mistakes in assignments that have yet to be marked the first unit one was due midnovember and i completed it but i am stressed over the harvard referencing because of the font size and to be completely honest i do not know if i even referenced things right i even noticed just now that in my project proposal i gave the pathway for my last year course instead of the second year one so i am scared but at the same time i have seen other proposals and they do not include the pathway so i am unsure if i am in the clear or not arrgh the next unit is coming to a close like a week and i do not have any development to show for it but i have a ton of research this is mostly due to it being a teambased unit and we have been unsure as to what we were actually supposed to be making until only a week ago since our tutors kept giving us mixed messages lockdown has not made anything any better either we have to work at home now so our teams communication has gone down the drain the third unit has just started and it is going to be a specialised study unit which means a lot of it be just trying to find as much information about a couple of different artists i am not too stressed about this unit since i excel at independent study but it is also a matter of my fmp starting in a couple of weeks which will determine our end of year grade which will most likely determine whether i get accepted into uni i received a distinction last year in the firstyear course so all i need this year is to get a merit or higher however if i only get a pass then i will not have enough tariff points for the uni courses i applied to i am incredibly overloaded with stress and i have never really learnt how to get rid of it since my mind is always on overclock just overthinking every minor thing please someone give me advice or tell me how to stop this
1,life does not get better unless you take actions to make it better but depression itself can make it impossible to act exercisephysical activity eating healthy spending time in nature finding a hobby are all things that are supposed to be good for your mental health but by definition depression is a problem precisely because it inhibits your inability to function much less do things that are good for you finding a therapist trialling multiple therapists to see which one suits me best or even starting on antidepressants and having to check in with a doctorpsychiatrist every few weeks or having to change medications because one might fuck up my head even more or not even work all takes so much fucking effort that i cannot bother to do any of it i went to a counsellor at my university earlier this year and they suggested things like group therapy for my anxiety and volunteering for causes because that can give people a sense of purpose in day to day life and i just did not know how to tell them that is exactly the problem i have utterly no will to do any of that and that is why i am sitting in your office right now and i do not know what anyone can possibly do about me being this way if people with depression were able to so easily do things to help themselves we would not need to classify it as an illness or disorder that is why it is so infuriating when we see how even professional mental health advocacy organizations repeat the hackneyed slogans which i cannot understand how they are even still in mass circulation it is so irrational and frustrating that i am physically able to take ten steps out of the house to just go on a goddamn walk but i have absolutely no mental will to do anything but lie in bed only listening to music is the only action that can be done purely passively with no effort whatsoever but then i just get sad and start spiralling from guilt and i cannot stop thinking about how irrational it is even though i have experienced it for so many years i am constantly surprising myself from my own incompetence as if i ever expected anything different more than hopelessness i just feel confused as to what i am supposed to do when i cannot will myself to do anything what even is this anymore edit thank you for all the comments i did not expect to get any response it is hard to describe but i feel very moved that there are people out there that i reached in a small way for a short moment of time
1,losing control of my life rant this is just me ranting but any help will be very much appreciated i am a sophomore in highschool taking all honors and ap classes my time management has never been the best but i have managed to go through middle school with basically all as when sophomore year came along i did not know how to handle all the work plus trying to maintain a healthy lifestyle eventually the semester exams rolled in and that was when it got really bad i would not sleep or eat for days always staying in my room trying to cram in order to get my grades up to all as kept this up for a little more than a month and passed the exams but i was so unimaginably burnt out and had basically no energy left at all we had winter break for a couple weeks and i hoped that this will help get my energy back for the next semester it is been months now and i still do not feel right the way i got my work done before is obviously not the healthiest but at least i got it done now i am always thinking about the things i need to finish but never actually doing them worst part is i do not even procrastinate by doing the things i considered fun probably would just lie down and watch youtube or look at memes for hours not really enjoying it but at least i can take my mind off of work for a bit it makes me a little sad to know that the things i am learning at school would be things i would be interested in but the deadlines and assignments kind of turned potentially fun topics i could be passionate about into just another load of stuff i need to do i never go out and hang out with friends anymore when i do it is because i force myself so days just consist of me alternating between finishing work and just mindlessly looking through stuff on reddit me and my family are from a third word country we moved to the us because of my dads job my parents were not well off financially at all growing up they say that if they could endure a life with hardships like that i can deal with a little bit of stress and because of that i am always questioning if i am just whining and milking this to be a bigger deal than it is or if this is something serious i need to fix it really feels as if i am wasting my entire life and that there is no way to pick myself back up again because if i do take time to rest or figure things out for a couple days it is as if i am be taking time away from schoolwork if you read this far thanks for hearing me out have a nice day
1,i cannot seem to find anything worth the effort hello i just need a place to vent i do not know if it makes sense or not i feel that i have been living under this fog for the last 2 or 3 years everything lost its meaning nothing seems meaningful anymore i just cannot find the energy to even try to try new stuff i am constantly bored but at the same time not doing anything to have fun nothing is fun anymore i stopped trying now i just exist that is it i only exist but not in any meaningful way the worst part is the following i was supposed to be succesful my family had huge hopes for me and they tried to give me everything i need i have everything i need i do not have any reason to be like this unhappy and bored all the time but i am this caused me to slowly hate myself and now i literally hate myself i just hate the person that i see every night in the mirror i just hate him with all my gut i pushed people out of my life i think i did it deliberately because i did not want anyone to see me like this i did not let them know that i became a failure not even trying to do anything about it eventually everybody moved on i am not blaming them it is not like they are supposed to waste their time trying to help a hopeless case like me it makes sense that they moved on now everybody is trying to improve themselves and i just have this hate towards everyone nobody did anything wrong and i just hate them for having the courage to try being happy i just hate them for not hating themselves three seconds after they wake up i just hate them for getting out of bed and start their day trying to get better and improve themselves this caused me to push everyone even further i cannot contact people because i do not want to answer the question so what are you doing these days because i do not have an answer to give i am not doing anything i never thought that i was going to become this disgusting human being that literally does not do anything does not try to get anything done and hates other people for doing stuff i just hate myself and i do not think that there is any hope left i am just stuck inside my brain i just do not think that there is anything left for me on this planet i am done i will just keep existing until someone takes this shit life away from me i just wished there was a way to give my life to someone who has a terminal illness but who wants to live i just wish that this torment ended
1,i need your opinion please so my severely depressed ex boyfriend broke up with me some days ago he was distancing for two months now i tried everything i could but it reached its peek and he told me he needs to let me move on he will not get better and i deserve someone who can give me the world it was all really respectful and caring on the one hand he tells me he needs someone he can see and have things in common on the other hand he says he does not need anybody or anyone anymore he just wants to be alone completely he barely even talks to family but he says they know what his problems are and it is his fight he says he does not feel anything anymore he does not know who or what he is it is like he lost himself he said the guy i knew and fell in love with is gone and dead and he had to get rid of him to get stronger and better does anyone know why or what could have happened all got really bad two weeks ago when something happened related to his dad who died surprisingly without anyone knowing he could not say goodbye and he was his best friend from then on he only wanted to be alone and i let him but now he broke up and said we will never be together and it is not our choice to make he is also suicidal cannot talk about what is going on and also has adhd and autism spectrum disorder i could tell he was always kind of depressed from time to time and that he is struggling with low self esteem and hate for himself he was slowly drifting away he used to be so in love with me wanted to make things work and was kind and lovely and then he distanced said he is at a dark place and from then it went downhill he shut me out and kept on pushing me away and even broke up over text because he cannot talk i know this is probably the end he said he will not message me again even though he reached out to me to ask if i am okay after the break up is this not only depression but also some kind of trauma why destroy the person you were and decide to kill the love too that we had i can tell it bothers him when i bring the good old times up he keeps saying i should stop bringing things up what happened to him this cannot be just depression right i know it will not change anything but i have to get this off my chest he wants me to forget him and move on but it was important to him to let me know nothing of this is my fault and i did not do anything wrong it is all on him please help me to understand i need closure
1,is not sure what is happening so i am not really here to use this as a diagnosis this is more so for me to see if this is genuine enough to seek help or just to generally get an idea of what is wrong i am not sure that it can be classified as depression but i did not really know where else to go sometimes i really worry alot that maybe i am subconsciously doing this for attention or something like that or i am just being dramatic and not knowing it to start off though whenever i am feeling fine i am a pretty motivated person i really like to work out and box its one fo my favorite things to do i am in college and i get pretty good grades i love to explore and try new things i am a big foodie maybe even to the point i eat way more than i should haha however i have periods of time where i just feel very very unhappy and unsatisfied with everything i can usually tell when it is about to start it begins with me kind of zoning out alot more and i will start to have times where i question existence and everything seems kind of fake these times kind of suck because i start to feel like everything i am doing is pointless and i just want to drop out and leave then i start to get extremepy irritable i am pretty much mad at everything and i will even make stupid arguments with my gf and look for reasons to be angry this is then followed by a period where i am just unhappy i guess i am not sure if that is the right word i am not necessarily sad all the time although i am much more likely to be sad but its mostly just i do not want to exist i guess like its so hard to just do anything and it kind of puts a strain on my relationship because i do not want to talk or go anywhere or even cuddle with my girlfriend everything i try to do is just unsatisfying i cannot even sit on tik tok or play games i just want to do absolutely nothing and be alone and it makes me genuinely so sad when my girlfriend wants me to get out of bed during good periods the unhappiness will only last a few days during bad times it can last a week or two the zoning out and irritability will usually start 13 weeks before depending on how bad it is its all a slow build up then it slowly goes away this all happens kind of randomly maybe once every other month during the summer it gets much worse during the winter it lasts longer and is much more intense i really just want to know if this is genuine or not i am really unsure sometimes
1,no matter what i do it will never be enough for me no matter how much time i spend with the family i have left i am still depressed no matter how many friends i will make i will still be depressed even a loving relationship still does not distract me from the pain and i thought that was working but all i felt was nothing in the end i still cry every goddamn day at this time alone with my thoughts and insecurities i hate this life i hate how i was born in such a horrible position you know life would actually be a lot easier if my abusers were not fucking immediate family members but what is the point of pitying myself and what is the point of being hard on myself either i worked so hard only for a memory to kill the reality i had built for myself i have dated so many people and for what to be sexually abused just like my mother did to me just like my brother did to me it does not matter if he remember or thought it is wrong at the time he will be dead like her i will still resent him like i still do with her i always wonder what life is like in other parts of the world what life being in a cabin is like isolated from the world or being in arranged marriage different cultures and rituals the primitive life those kinds of lives are not simple but nothing actually is it is just different ways of surviving different ways of thinking but the complexity of it all is still the same and this life is not any different where i have expectations to keep up with the suburban life have children get married and get a good job so i can keep the house and it sounds so easy but it is the hardest challenges i do not have a job i do not even know how to ride a bike let alone a car i do not normally admit this but i feel like amberlynn reid i live pretty much like her and i am so ashamed of it i eat food do nothing but listen to music and maybe just maybe play video games and it sucks that i am so pretty but i have such poor health i have hit rock bottom in life but i guess starting now while i am still alive i will not live like this what is the point of living in a life i never dreamed of being in i never wanted the american dream life did i in the end it is an american nightmare for me never live like this never again even though my life was so luxurious and even though i am both mentally and physically weak and i will be uncomfortable for a lot of it i will not let me kill myself
1,stressed out of my mind and trying to hide it so i am 15 and recently my family bought our first apartment we used to just rent it was already stressful at the beginning looking for an affordable yet good place cuz my dad was worried about not being able to pay rent for any longer due to covid and my parents not being able to work so fast forward we move to the new place and hand over our old apartment i do not really want to go into the details but long story short my dad is planning on suing the seller of the new apartment for misleading stuff meanwhile at our old place there is a possibility of them suing us and now i am just fucking scared to be honest i have never had the word sue applied in my life before and it is still taking me time to process the situations we are in a fucked situation and me being 15 and not knowing a lot regarding this i am really scared and worried for my family my dad and my brother are managing all of this so i do not want to burden them even more with my emotions i got the news of all the suing 2 days ago and since then i have been having panic attacks rarely happens for me i do not have any mental health conditions and hiding up in my bunk bed to cry we are also just an average family so i am really scared about how all of this could affect our financial situation and what would happen if we lose i am also really worried about my dad since covid started it has affected my parents business a lot so he had to take car of that along with finding a new home and then the moving process now all the suing and he cannot even catch a break my mind is just running with a lot of fear and anxiety from the moment i wake up to me tossing and turning in bed at night which i am having trouble containing i think i am even having those hypertension thingys cuz my head hurts all the time and whenever i am on my phone and i read smt related to law or legal stuff i just feel like crying on top of all this i am trying to do my homework but sitting at my desk this just resonates at the back my mind i know writing this on here is pointless cuz no one can do anything but just letting it out to strangers has helped a little bit i am still pretending to act normal towards my friends and family but my soul feels lost i am also not in the mindset of why is this happening to my family but moreso how the fuck are we going to get through this i am justreally scared
1,fell off the boat relapsed back into depression just a reminder for those that you should always be on top of your depression even when you do not feel it long story short a few years ago i checked myself into an outpatient center to get my depression under control it worked wonders and it was the best thing i have ever done for myself after i got out i was seeing a regular therapist however i was stuck in a toxic job that kept on triggering my depression and fucking up my recovery found a promising new job but that one ended up being even more toxic met my current bf at that time and he convinced me to quit and it was the only job i ever rage quit and told the people to fuck off felt good ended up being a great choice because i decided to get my cdl and it is been awesome so far really got my shit in gear the job is fun as hell i make really good money it is challenging in all the right kind of ways where you get these little senses of accomplishment here and there me and my bf also have a home together and it is great but back to my point about staying on your treatment sometime inbetween going from the one toxic job to the other i stopped seeing my psychologist i was losing my health insurance at the time but i was on such a high from getting this new job it did not bother me long story short went through that hole toxic episode and a severe down but i blamed it on the job and not the depression once i got my cdl i was actually feeling happy and great depression is an asshole though and knows how to creep back in now that i have been driving semis for close to 2 years the job has gotten very routine and i started falling back into old thought processes the ones were all familiar with they start slow like a dropping pipe until the pipe eventually bursts so you really do not notice it but they are there that one small familiar though eventually grows routes until you relapse like i did and you are back in that dark place with no escape that is where i am at now got to almost start from 0 again luckily i have much more control on it and know what to do but still this is something you truly got to actively manage everyday even when you do not feel you need to because it will creep back up at some point just always stay active and watch the warning signs so you do not spiral we can beat depression but we all need to remember to stay active and progressive
1,i am a masochist i am at the edge i will not commit suicide but the depression has pretty much taken over my life my depression is not me it is a disease this disease has manifested itself into me discarding selfcare i do not want to buy new clothes for myself engage in any enjoyable hobbies or do anything that i would enjoy i keep putting those things off every day for the past two years i have been putting off selfcare because i am not there yet it is this perpetual feeling of inadequacy of constantly trying to catch up i think school partially did this to me i was conditioned into prioritizing work first and foremost it instilled into me a kind of selflessness leisure was relegated to 20 or so minutes of recesslunch it was not important this is not an angsty school sucks sentiment i mean it does but my viewpoint does not come from a place of complete directionless anger i do not want to blame anything for my problems but the cold truth is that school rewards masochism which i in part adopted i tried to escape the stress by procrastinating which would lead me to missing deadlines which resulted in selfhatred i had to escape the stress along with myself it is funny because i was not even that good of a student what was the point in studying when i am was and am so unhappy i am a masochist i put off happiness because i feel as if i do not deserve it it makes me feel inhuman who would do such a thing i have not felt happiness in literal years even during moments of leisure i never felt content i always had to be doing something because productivity is an instilled and admirable trait i feel warped i do not feel human i let everything pass me by i am so fucked up i will not commit suicide i cannot but right now the thoughts are taking full force i am so disgusted with myself that i do not even behave like a normal person that i am so compulsive and masochistic and crazy i have nothing i am lonely i am selfless i just want it all to end i want to wake up as a normal person i feel dysphoria with myself as a person not gender dysphoria but the term in a general sense an unease and deep dissatisfaction with myself even when i should be feeling happy i am not everything just feels so fake and shallow how can someone like me ever heal if their brain has been wired like this for so long this chemical imbalance is only getting worse
1,i am really losing it and i cannot afford therapy right now sorry if this is long i genuinely have no one else to talk to and i have never opened up to anyone about this my parents are also between jobs so they neither have the insurance nor the money to afford a therapist i am 22 years old in my last year of my doctorate i skipped many grades and i have even passed difficult international business exams recently but life just hurts i feel like i have always pushed myself beyond limits because if i stop i will go back to wanting to kill myself i have friends but for the last 7 years i have always had to pretend to be happy so none of them really know me i have always been the one person in the room who was just never having fun always wanting to go back home crawl in my bed and have dark fantasies about being hurt enough to finally make the ultimate decision i cannot open up to anyone because no one knows how to react to my depression let alone my suicidal mindset i have tried some meds for a month and it helps slightly but i am so ashamed of taking them i have not refilled my prescription and i do not intend to i refuse to be dependent and weak i am writing because after several years i have noticed behaviors in me i never had before 2 months ago i had something hurtful happen to me socially and since then i have been hitting myself and screaming fuck you to myself when i am driving with my thoughts i have no energy but i keep working my efficiency is only 13 of what it should be but it is the most i can do to keep going i am tired even if i could afford therapy if i tell my therapist that i am really suicidal at times i will be forcefully admitted into a hospital and my doctorate will be postponed by a year if that happens i will be extremely suicidal there is nothing wrong with me physically i am average height no deformities no issues regarding intelligence i am okay yet i still just want to end things i also believe it is absolutely unfair for someone to be in a relationship with me how could i burden anyone with this i cannot share this pain because it is horrible and no one should have to deal with this not that most girls would anyway how long could someone realistically stay and help someone who is self esteem is shattered and cannot ever open up but looks extremely depressed anyway just wanted to let this out anonymously somewhere thanks
1,i need at least one person to see this i have 0 reason to live because i cannot care about my obligations to others if you google reasons to live they pretty much all say that they carry on living because they do not want to cause pain to their loved ones i have very little loved ones and i cannot express enough how little i give a shit about how sad they are going to be when i kill myself there is no way they will feel as terrible as i do everyday at least have the ability to get over it whereas i am condemned to this suffering until i die some other way i think about how my girlfriend will feel if she finds out i have killed myself and i just do not care i love more than anything even more than myself but i want death so badly that there is nothing that convince not to do it now my mum dad brother grandad grandma and literally everybody in my family will be devastated beyond words and i am fine with that because i will have victory for once i will fixed it at the greatest possible cost and i am glad their sadness is of no concern of mine when i am fucking dead i do not enjoy living as i have stated in other posts i do not care about the little things in life the smell of freshly cut grass is not a valid reason to fucking live you jackass i may laugh at things that are funny and may enjoy making others laugh and enjoy the company and love of my girlfriend but it just is not enough i need some other way of relief of my problems if not suicide i am not fucking willing to put in any hard work because i could just kill myself lol i need a giant stroke of luck or a huge incredibly forgiving second chance that will just make everything go away i wish all my problems could just be fixed by some miracle solution and they all say it is just hard work that will fix it but no pal it is suicide and it is a legitimate solution it ends my problems and that is all i want i am quite frankly sur people are not just okay with people suicide and that it does not happen even more than it does it is just such an absolute and perfect solution for everything the only reason people stop is because they feel obligated to others but i just do not have that filter i feel oddly free in the solace that suicide gives me whenever a new problem arises it does not affect me anymore because i know that one day i will not have to deal with this shit because i will be dead and buried

1,can we discuss each others experiences of feeling lost i have had depression for about 4 years i am 17 and started cutting around 11 but i was always out and about around that time i was very social i talked to so many people i had a lot of messed up stuff happen in life by that point but i always brushed it off but it always was there i made friends easily but around 8th grade it is like a switch went off i could not socialize anymore i could not focus on anything i kept sleeping so damn much i knew the consequences of missing school and i continued to sleep in i got kicked out of school became a drop out tried to go back to school later that year ended up having a anxiety attack got sent to mental health place but never got treatment never went back i did nothing these past 4 years nothing i ghosted all my friends i hate everything about myself i constantly compare myself i missed out on life experiences i finally got treatment last october on medication lexapro and it worked i felt great i had a routine i was working out like yeah woo i am finally going to go to highschool but never did i felt like i was going to get better i was taking my ged classes i got my first job i met new people but i do have to say the first month i was so anxious i would go to work shaking everyday i had some huge freakout moments where i felt like i could not breathe and was overwhelmed it was the first time in a long time i had to be around a lot of people but i pushed myself now that i was out in the world again i did not know who i was i am still confused i stopped meds for around a month and a half and felt happy at that time sort of i had to push myself out and since i met new people they would always try to get me to experience new things invite me to gatherings they made me feel like family i quit in the end of july and this month is hitting me hard i got upped my dosage and still feel so low i am isolating myself again i had a test yesterday and i missed it because i could not get out of bed i cannot get out of bed to the point i am starving but will not get up all foods feel disgusting i tried to hang out with people july but it feels like everyone had something to talk about it feels strange these people spoke to me when i was not so quiet 4yr these people did something every other day and i just have a blank space in my mind i feel like i have no identity
1,my friend attempted suicide a couple days ago my family is saying i will ruin christmas if i spend time with her in the hospital on christmas eve instead of visiting them what can i do a good friend of mine with whom i have been attending therapy for bpd overdosed a couple days ago she survived and was transported unconscious to the hospital she woke up but is unsurprisingly devastated i want to be there as her support she has a boyfriend but no family members who care about her and few friends i had plans to see my family for christmas but when this happened it left me deeply depressed particularly because another good friend of mine had committed suicide four years ago almost on the same day to elaborate i do not like spending christmas with my family i like them but christmas has always been more about chores and preparations than about quiet and peace i thought i would spend christmas by visiting my friend in the hospital i do not want her to be alone i know that if i were in her situation i would appreciate it if someone came to visit me so i proposed this to my mother and brother even the possibility that i would spend the afternoon with her and then go down to see them before dinner however their comments left gasping for air they showed little empathy for my friend or me my mother asked me if i had any normal friends my brother told me that while it is ultimately my choice i would be ruining christmas by not coming down or even by coming down just for dinner that everyone would be disappointed in me and it would create arguments implying i would be at fault for them here is the breakdown with my family i risk being ostracized for weeks if not months if i do not go down there however i have felt more and more like they were less and less my family while i have felt like my friends have shown more compassion and empathy for my depression and bpd than my family ever has in fact they have dismissed it as me not having enough social activity as not having enough will and have called my therapy a waste of time i feel like visiting my friend is the right thing to do i know i will think of her the whole time i would be down at my familys but i do not want to be ostrasized for months i do not think i could handle it with my mental condition any and all thoughts are welcome thank you
1,the way i looked at my depression helped me tremendously i see depression being regarded as a monster a beast a fight and a crushing weight and i too for many years viewed it in those ways it was hard and at times i felt as i could not escape one day at my absolute lowest i decided to change my perspective on it just to see if it would even make a difference boy did it for me i looked at it like an amusement park and roller coasters you can sorta guess how this goes but please allow me to explain walking through the park at that level we feel our baseline normal the rides represent our mental and emotional highs and lows in life everyone walks through the park for some that is all they do and they are content others get on the gentler rides they experience both highs and lows but not to extremes again still content then there are the coasters many people get on them and then never again others keep riding their favorite one for me i was the one rushing between all of them running through the park to catch the next not staying in my baseline for very long my depression shared a relationship with those roller coasters never staying the same and some bigger or scarier than others seeing the highest points between the drop of pure passionate joy the lows with twists and turns leaving me in fear and then returning to the station filled with gratitude that it is over safely but here is were i saw beauty in thismy life is passionate those high points i feel so deeply those lows as well but it is exhilarating through it all and i know i will return to the station safe and sound bringing friends and family to share in the beautiful moments and hold your hand through the scary recognizing my support system that way feels wonderful and let us not forget therapy or medication personally unmedicated but open to it i look at them like other riders especially ones you just cannot help but laugh or giggle at when they are over the top or cracking jokes they help make those fearful moments really not so bad i just wanted to share this with whomever decides to read this just looking at my depression in a different way helped me tremendously in acknowledging and moving forward in where i am and how to handle the difficult times does anyone else have any similar methods that helped
1,struggling recently i am using this subreddit as kind of a way to vent because i feel awful for telling my girlfriend these things almost everyday for the past few weeks life has been kind of sucky lately and it is almost entirely because of me i feel like my m relationship with my girlfriend is falling apart because of my stress hence my posting here insecurities paranoia and anxiety i saw her over break on christmas eve and christmas day as well as a few times when i have visited at work but we have not been able to hang out by ourselves to just talk face to face partly because she is busy and partly because of her parents for context we usually hung out many days a week before and after school i however have convinced myself she does not want to see me and is therefore avoiding me i think that she just does not really like me much anymore which sucks because afaik she does and she tells me she does but i tell myself otherwise i have convinced myself she likes someone else or likes something in a guy that i do not have i feel bad for talking to her about my thoughts and feelings because i feel like i am burdening her with them i feel like she views me as weak unattractive and all the other bad things i am beginning to think she just wants to leave but just is not i have convinced myself of these things despite having zero evidence to support it other than the things i misconstrue and misinterpret as evidence i have already begun searching for therapists for myself but i fear the damage may be done i do not know what to do anymore for me or for her to make it better i feel like an awful boyfriend and i feel lessthan i want to do better by her because i really love her and want to salvage our relationship and make things okay again i hypothesize sometimes about social medias impact on my thoughts almost everywhere i turn on reddit twitter or instagram i see a meme tweet or advice post about a cheating lying or otherwise shitty spouseso and so i seem to have misrepresented the whole of relationships because of the part that i see online i do not know thanks for reading my long and boring rant tldr life sucks because i feel bad sad and i worry a lot feel like my relationship with my girlfriend is falling apart trying to do better but do not know how to
1,my pain 25f is overwhelming i have been quarantining in an abusive household for the last year and am in need of some kind words i have been struggling a lot this week my mental health has always been shit but lately it is just gotten worse i recently fired my therapist because my insurance changed and she was not accepting the new provider she was not a good fit for me either but something is better than nothing so aside from my boyfriend and a few friends i do not have anyone i can rely on i feel bad venting to the people around me because they are all going through tough times too and it just does not feel fair for me to unload on them so i hope that opening up to this sub is the right idea even though i still feel guilty expressing my pain the heart of it all is that i have cptsd along with other psych disorders and these past few weeks i have been drifting in and out of disassociation flashbacks and episodes of crying fits i cannot stop reliving my trauma and am having a tough time with positive selftalk right now i would say my selfworth and selfesteem are at a 0 it does not help that i live in an abusive household but unfortunately i do not have anywhere else to go and this is something i have dealt with my whole life my mother is neglectful and my father is emotionally verbally and sometimes physically abusive he picked a fight with me this morning for no reason and it set me over the edge so between the flashbacks disassociation and deeply painful depression i just feel so unsafe in my house if my parents see me crying they will either gaslight or bully me i just wish things were different i do not really know where i am going with this post other than it would be nice to be reminded that not everyone is mean and nasty that i am a good person and i deserve a good life i just want to stop crying edit thank you for the wholesome the silver and the hugz loudly_crying_face loudly_crying_face loudly_crying_face i did not expect this post to get any attention let alone receive my first reddit awards i am crying tears of joy and hope now thank you kind internet strangers i will be sure to pay it forward 3 edit 2 wow this outpouring of support was so not expected i am trying to respond to everyone but it is taking longer than expected so in the case that i missed your comment thank you
1,today on the way to work i thought about how nice it would if someone would crash in to me or non fatally shoot me just so i would get the day off work i struggle everyday with waking up going to work there are days where i have a text typed out to my boss and i just sit there and stare at for a minute before i delete it and go back in to drone mode i do not dislike the people i used to enjoy the type of work i do but we are essentially mandated to work i feel like we are all living in survival mode trying to make bank we are destroying ourselves for what unless i am lucky i have to give 40 some odd years of my life to our labor force then i will be lucky if i get 10 years to enjoy when i am old frail and probably riddled with medical issues a different job will not help extended time off has not helped work itself is just slowly draining my life force 10 years has taken it is toll on me and i cannot see myself doing another 10 to 30 i was fired last year took some time off before finding a new job my mental health improved i started to do things again i enjoyed waking up every morning i even enjoyed going to bed i ate healthier i unintentionally lost some weight i still had issues but things were so much better now that i am working again i have stopped taking good care of myself again i hate waking up every morning i am filled with anxiety i eat foods that make me ill i am ignoring family and friends again things are going right back to where they were i hate life you cannot just stop working because you cannot just stop paying bills every single morning i start my day with back pain because i cannot mentally get myself to get a new mattress i do not clean except my body and clothes before work i stop brushing my teeth every day i feel like a need to power cycle my brain i am becoming something i do not want that i do not like and i feel like i am not in control i feel like i am the verge of a mental breakdown almost every day the wrong words or tone of voice could set me off i get angered by something as simple as a phone notification i have this constant feeling of doom that will not go away i am so exhausted i have an appointment with a new pcp tomorrow that i have been waiting weeks for i do not have high hopes it will be of any help but i hope someone can help me because i cannot help myself

1,chronic stress relief please help hi i am writing this post because i am to be blunt very desperate for stress relief i am only 19 but about half of my life has been spent trying to cope with things that were abnormally stressful in comparison to my peers my parents getting divorced in 5th grade quickly turned into my mother being emotionally abusive my new stepdad making my moms house very unsafe and my mom taking his side and doing very out of pocket things to try to get us to pity her pretending to be stalked faking cancer allegedly being poisoned etc ever since this began i had always followed an escapist route so much so like that i developed a form of psychosis that led me to believe that this world was entirely a dream and that i had more control over things than i actually do i have undergone a lot of persona mental illness related troubles as well and it truly seems as if there is no situational stress relief in february of 2020 however things took a turn for the worse due to extenuating circumstances i was facing an incredible amount of financial stress and had to scrounge for money to buy dinner i started experiencing debilitating stomach pain that doctors could not pinpoint quarantine followed shortly thereafter and then i moved 2 hours away from everyoneeverything in order to go to college i had no money and no friends and my grades began to slip my stomach pains got worse and then i also started to experience sleep issues that make it virtually impossible to wake up on time for work class etc unless i have slept 12 hours i have seen so many specialists to no avail and these health issues simply exacerbate all of the other familial academic and financial burdens i am facing i have been trying to be as patient as i can but i have now been told that the majority of my health issues are caused by stress itself this is a catch22 in many ways and this news in and of itself is a stressor now i am hyperaware of my stress and feel like i cannot do anything without getting chest pains i am getting a new psychiatrist and therapist but my appointments are not for a while but i am not functional until then i do things to destress daily art talking to my familyboyfriend etc but it is clearly not enough any help is appreciated thanks
1,i feel like i am watching my life crash and i cannot stop it this all started in october i lost my mom on the 11th that alone is still hard to deal with she was my rock my person to run to when i was stressed or could not figure how to handle certain things as a parent or as an adult there were understandably missed days of work which caused lost wages only two days were covered for me and my husband was out of vacation days none were covered for him this caused us to fall back on a few bills we live on a tight budget as it is there was no insurance for mom so no way to financially put back our wages it started a slow spiral littered with late fees and then came early december where we had a choice of keeping our place to live or keeping our car we lost our car luckily my dad was able to step in and was helping us get to and from work until we could get a car but three days ago they put his dad on the morphine drip he is watching his dad die in the same slow manner he watched my mom the hospice nurses oddly the same ones who saw my mom out have turned his oxygen up to 5 and understandably my dad does not want to leave his side so here we are i am about to call my job for the second day and beg for a ride or not to get fired my husbands parents are sort of helping him but still leaving it up in the air everyday before he is supposed to be at work but i work the overnight no one is willing to help me get there and home we have called taxi services around us it would cost over 100 for him to get to work and back and close to 50 for me this is crazy and i am so nervous everything at once i am worried about losing my job then losing the roof we fought so hard to keep over our kids head we gave up our car to keep no matter how hard we work no matter that both of us have rarely missed days and worked for the same companies for years both very good workers but one horrible moment in my life has us standing on the edge of losing everything we make too much to ask the state for help but not enough to miss a few days to grieve the loss of the best person in our family without ruining our lives i am just on the edge and i have no idea what i am supposed to do anymore and the one person who would know who could help is not around to help us thanks for listening well reading i guess
1,help coping with extreme long term stress i am going crazy hi i am 18 and i have been non stop stressed since midmarch it started during spring break when all of my roommates went home except for me i am really bad at being alone it made me so anxious and stressed that i got the flu and a severe uti as well as abdominal pain later because i was stressed about the uti i got really bad chest pain then i started my first major curriculum class which stressed me out because the teacher was tough and i was the only freshman then we had to choose housing and there was not enough housing for every student good job school so that had me freaking out pretty horribly then it was time to move out of the freshman dorms which was a bit overwhelming in may my dad told me that he was selling his house and he was not very nice about it i am really emotionally attached to that house so that is stressing me out a lot too the thought of leaving it makes me want to just lay down on the floor and cry in fact i have done so and he is not being sympathetic at all as in when i get sad about it he tells me to grow the hell up so that is a constant stresser then my dad and my aunt got in a massive fight and my dad pulled out of helping me buy my plane ticket to visit her in la my friends had already gotten their tickets and i had to find a way to get mine on my own my place of work closed in january and i need so much time off this summer that nobody in their right mind would hire me all the while i was caught right in the middle of their insane argument i got really close to cancelling the trip that was the catalyst for my current predicament i think i am currently sick and i have been for two weeks i feel horrible all of the time and get nauseous and dizzy after eating my heartbeat skyrockets and i get really shaky too i saw my gp and after a physical examination she chalked it up to all of the stress coming down pretty hard on me i cannot keep letting this stress rule over me like this it is literally making me sick what are some ways that i can go about coping with it and keeping it from kicking me to the ground like this i have got to do something i am on medication but since it is a new prescription it is going to be a month or so before i see any real improvement
1,i could use some encouragementadvice so this is my first time posting so a little backstory my grandparents passed away in 20002001 all 4 2 of whom helped raise me my brother passed away in 2001 my mom passed away in 2015 while i was pregnant so that was super hard she was depressed and it was suicide my dad had bad health for 5 years leading up to his death i managed his care weekly and when i went on a mission trip for two weeks the only time i was ever unreachable about his care he passed away within 2 days of me returning because no one listened to me before i left when i asked for him to be checked and treated for a uti i have another brother who has been missing for 2 years now there is one more potential brother out there that my dad fathered through an affair but i cannot find him and he wants nothing to do with my family that family is just me now honestly it feels brutal crushing i should have a huge family but i do not it is just me although i have a wonderful husband and amazing 5 year old daughter i feel alone a lot i take my medication and it helps very much but honestly i feel hollow a lot of the time i want parents and siblings and i feel so robbed of that not that my life is not wonderful it is something just feels missing and i feel so hollow does anyone ever feel this way like you should be happy because you have a great life descent job great immediate family but you are not you feel empty from your loss of family and knowing you are the only surviving family all by 35 my husband is an only child and i try to bond with his mother his dad has passed away too but we are so different and she is judgmental their is not much of a bond there i have tried so many times i get really upset when i hear friends complain about their family most times i just bite my tongue often times i just cannot get out of this rut like i wish an adult family would adopt me so i do not feel so broken and can have a mom to turn to again not that my family was amazing they were not a lot of drug use and emotional abuse but they are family you know my mom got better in her old age as did my dad but my childhood was no cakewalk something that has taken a lot of therapy to move on from and forgive what is your advice on dealing with this
1,i do not think this is depression but it sure feels like it hello i am in a weird situation right now and i do not really know who to talk to about it or anything so i am hoping i might get some help or support here i have had bad depression years ago after my sister passed i could not be happy no matter what i talked to my doctor who convinced me to go to a psych ward in a hospital i am sure it was precautionary and meant to be helpful but it was more annoying than anything i had no inclination to self harm was stuck in a boring and sometimes scary place for 12 hours to finally be discharged by a psychologist at 2am meanwhile my husband is crying at home i felt a little played i was on antidepressants for about a year and then got through the depression thing have been great since then but about a month ago i noticed a change it happened when i got back from vacation my anniversary is on the 25th and my birthday is the 26th so my husband and i took a vacation that week it was fun busy but when i got back to the normal routine i just do not have the desire to do anything anymore i used to play games on my computer for hours now i just kind of sit here i would find a ton of things to do while working now i do not really want to do anything when my husband would be at work i would try learning to mod a game or when he was home we would watch tv and stuff i still do that but have no interest to do anything else i am still happy at least with my husband i still look at memes and laugh i still love hanging with my dogs but i am just not interested in anything else this was different from my last depressive episode but feels pretty similar except before i did not find almost any interest in anything while now i kind of do not want to do anything especially alone i hope this is making sense i do not know if this is depression again but not a typical depression last time i had depression my doctor suspected a big vitamin d deficiency i had at the time so maybe it is something similar i have adhd and was off my usual routine for over a week maybe there is a resistance to the drugs and i am searching for a dopamine hit i do not know but it is frustrating and i cannot seem to get out of the funk of whatever it is for the last month
1,constant noise pollution contributing to chronic stress can anyone relate in the last few years of my life in 3 different cities i have somehow managed to live into neighborhoods where they tend to knock down houses to build multifamily ugly looking beatle juice houses that seem to take ages to complete i guess it probably takes a lot of effort to hang up all those light fixtures on the cheap particle board on top of that the places i work are also constantly going under development as the onsite locations from my jobs tend to be in heavilytrafficked areasit is gotten to a point where i cannot ignore it anymore there is a project that went up to our surprise after a year of living here and no one in our complex has been able to park in front of our unit in over a year this morning they are working on the street for god knows what reason i know they are just doing their job but i am just venting and wondering if anyone has similar experiences or if i am just being too sensitive i have been dealing with a lot of emotional pain recently due to the death of a few loved ones and it is been making it very difficult for me to work to begin with after taking two days off and feeling ready to dive back into work i sat down at my desk at home with a cup of coffee and immediately the jackhammers down the alley started i just do not know what to do about this anymore there does not seem to be any place you can live with limited income to escape the constant traffic fire sirens and construction work i have been taking my son out for hikes in parks in the weekend and sure that is great for getting away from it all but how the fuck do i continue to deal with this and be productive it is almost like even if i can block the noise out my the part of my brain responsible for detecting the noise is still active and irritated unfortunately i am a technical writer and find musicpodcasts just as distracting i have tried going to coffee shops and libraries to work but i find those environments hard to focus and do not want to have to go out of the way of my own house just to get some quiet i meditate daily run and do light yoga which helps me find peace of mind but i am finding of 8 years of this constant noise to be harder and harder to take restless in seattle thoughtabs
1,meeting a fellow suicidal student in middle school changed my outlook on life you really never know what is going on with someone this is a reminder to just be kind when you can because you do not know what is happening under the surface i was reading a post that reminded me of a certain conversation i had with a fellow student back in 7th grade i was in a lab group with three other kids and this guy who was insanely smart and always cracking jokes rolls up his sleeves he is got all these scars on them and so another girl in the group asks about them he just casually tells us he has a cutting problem his parents had to confiscate knives and things the rest of the group kind of just was like ok wow that is scary and then we just did the assignment i feel like i missed an opportunity there to help someone out this guy just opened up about something so personal and i sort of just was shocked and confused so i did not comfort him and i did not say anything touching or kind back honestly i think i just could not process it was he joking for me at least lots of people joked about depression and suicide all the time in middle school it had never occurred to me that some of these people actually felt that way when i think back on the whole interaction i realize i would never have known the internal struggle this guy had even existed if i did not just happen to be in his lab group and he just happened to roll up his sleeves i am also really bothered by the fact that no one was concerned in the group including myself another thing that severely bothers me is the fact that this was middle school i feel like that is so crazy young and the reality that kids were already facing so much pressure and stress forces me to seriously question what the heck is going on in society right now the main thing that this has taught me is that you seriously never know what someone is going through i would never have guessed that this kid hated themselves like that he was so smart i kind of was jealous at times and he made the wittiest jokes 247 and he was always smiling i do not know what has happened to him i think he switched schools the next year or moved or something wherever he is i hope he is doing well and i hope he is found some real support since our school did not provide it
1,is it worth waiting to see if your life eventually ever gets better i am about to turn 25 and i do not even want it this year the disingenuous attention is going to bum me out long story short i lost my job and then got stuck at my parents house my dad is very narcissistic and toxic and is often damaging to my mental health i spent this past year developing myself more learning more into my career reading books becoming spiritual and finding a because to do good in the world i figured all of this is pointless i might as well spend it doing at least one thing that is bigger than me and then i can die happy i do not need to be famous i just wish i can move the needle positively in society or in a community in some way i do not know what that is yet but i am learning a lot of marketing and i consider myself a creative and passionate individual i am a musician also i also volunteer and am involved but it is all remote right now i do not have a real job i have no friends and now my band is falling apart last year no one showed up to my birthday gathering which is kind of what caused me to start this journey i can start a new band by myself and i can move out and find new friends that are not toxic and like me and respect me maybe even find a girlfriend i used to have at least a couple of those things at different points in my life i have been through 12 salary paying job interviews these past 2 months and none of them bite now i have nothing and i spent a year on myself for nothing i have friends family and my therapist keep telling me just wait your time will come and other similar pointless advice that gives you nothing tangible to work with and instead is just your life sucks you cannot do anything about it just wait and see if it gets better well what if it does not what if i get hit by a car tomorrow god i really hope i do i mean i am thankful that i am healthy and alive under a house but i still pay exorbitant bills and it is really not easy even with a garbage freelance job i do not want to live through this bullshit anymore it is been a year i want my reparations back for all the people who lied to me for all this time am i being a freak or what why cannot i just catch a fucking break edit you guys are really sweet and this made my day thank you
1,i know the solution to not being depressed any longer but i cannot do it first off i want to mention that i am a mtf transgender i have a father who is a terrible person and i have extreme anger issues and anxiety i am no longer suicidal but i live in constant agony i am stuck inside a body with the wrong parts and hormones i believe that my body is a womans body and that i have the mind of a woman aside from the hormones and privates nothing about me is masculine in any way my father is just read the post i made about him its too much to even put into one sentence both of these things make me constantly upset the dysphoria and the abuse from my dad i am a few months shy of 15 years old meaning that i am not in control of my body all of these things make me so angry i already have anger issues but lately they have been even worse its so hard to control myself since nothing i have tried calms me and when i get angry i feel like i have no control over my body and i begin to shake and hit things also i am pretty sure that the testosterone has something to do with my anger i need two things that will help getting rid of my dad and fully transitioning now about my dad hes done nothing good one example i did not make in that post is that when i was depressed and suicidal pre transition i told him that my entire life has been a joke he yelled at me saying that your life has not even started yet post transition and now whenever i mention anything about how i do not want to think about myself pretransition he gets mad and talks about how many important things happened during that time and then if i mention the abuse from him that i associate with pretransition me he gets mad saying that he went through worse or that that is in the past which is what i am trying to get at i never ever felt like myself and now that i do i want nothing to do with the terrible things i went through when i did not even know who i was i do not know what i really expect from posting this here but i just really need to get this out i need him out of my life i need to fully transition this is what i need to do but i do not know how my childhood has already been wasted so i want to make the best of it before i have none left and it seems like that i cannot even get that
1,my 27m dad 58m killed himself and it is my fault my dad lived far away and i lived independently after a lot of quarrel with my relatives whom i stayed with for a while long story deserves its own post despite effectively being banished from the rest of the family i was still in good terms with my dad one day he asked for money said it was to start a business there and that i would get a share of the income i was struggling with my own career and even financially but i found my way to send the amount he requested anyway i was even jobless too ashamed to admit it when i sent the money a month passed and there was no update on the business i followed up and he said he was busy there was some delay etc even more months passed and there was barely anything i chattedtexted him and he said he will just return the money when he can turns out that he was financially struggling there as well i was able to find employment eventually but i was paranoid i do not have any savings on my own nor any emergency money my sick leaves are unpaid and i will not have income if i am sick with covid i kept asking him if he could send even a fraction of that amount i told him that i cannot even find workfromhome setups as i cannot afford the equipment needed he said he still could not send any amount at all i was mad i told him of all the times he told me i should have forgiven the family obey them blindly and so on and here we are now in a situation where they are not even helping him i urged him to just borrow from them they are well off i am not i am surviving by own monthly income with barely any savings plus i had to borrow a bit of money to send him which i still have to pay off he kept apologizing said he is trying to find a way i was losing my patience i kept followingup every week or so sometimes months i was also pissed because family already banished me and i feel like i am being forced to join this problem i had no reason to mistrust my dad and i am sure he genuinely needed help but the clan could help him better than i could one day he texted saying he can pay me back soon the next day i learned that he killed himself i did not want this to happen i know more context or info is needed so i will edit and comment along the way i am still shaken by this
1,i feel like i am screaming for help and no one is listening i have been trying to get better really trying i have met with doctors to adjust my meds i have missed 3 weeks of work getting all that shit sorted out and trying to prioritize my mental health only to miss 3 weeks of pay and stress myself out more as if 3 weeks could fix the 10 years of depression i feel like everyone underplays how i am feeling when i try to talk about it i cannot decide if i want to just disappear or end it my family only cares about me getting back to work it is always been about just getting back to work a job that i do not even get a lunch break during and no other breaks throughout the day i am a teacher for 6th graders do i like my job yeah is it worth sacrificing even 10 minutes to get a deep breath and thought process in not so sure yet everyone this whole time has just asked when do you go back to work not how am i doing how am i feeling just when do i start making money again and being a productive member of society or do it for the kids and sometimes i just want to scream that maybe i need to make a decision for me i think the kids will be more traumatized if they learn their teacher offed herself because she realized it is all fucking pointless no one understands unless they are going through it yet everyone wants to tell you what to do they will not say it but i know my parents and my boyfriend just think i am weak and dramatic my best friend at this point is my damn dog who is the best boy and i really think the only reason i have held on this long i am at the point where i know i really want it all to end but i wish a lightening bolt would just come down and do it for me so at least i will not have died in a way that proves i am in fact just a weak loser it sucks because i know i have passions and ambitions but they do not align with the way everyone else wants me to live my life and the cherry on top my fucking roommate is the most negative person i have ever met and leaves notes around the house about how much everything sucks i am negative too and agree everything sucks but goddammit i am trying here and that is not helpful even if it is sitting next to a fall scented candle i cannot escape the depression and the negativity and i am just so fucking exhausted
1,have melt downs every day i have been in a relationship for about three years now i started dating him in grade 10 the first year was amazing but then came lies ignoring me he once left me and went to wonderland with his friends he ignores me on all holidays saying that he is busy with his family busy enough that he will not even reply back to me i get mad and he says he loves me so much he never gets me any birthday gifts valentines day gifts anniversary gifts he lives around 2 hours away from me so whenever he comes i feel it is just for sexual favours and then he leaves and ignores me does not call me even if he does call me it is about horny stuff most of the time i have tried to break up with him but he does not let me and i get weak also i get weak to think that i cannot live without him and things will get better i lost my friends because of him i have no one to share anything with my parents are the worst my mom is the most judgemental person i have met i sometimes wish she was not my mom my sister does not like me i am not sure why she kind of gets my brother against me she yells and misbehaves with me and we are 13 years apart my mom is always taking her side and always favours her they all think i do nothing in life even though i work 20 hours a week and i study fulltime at utm so recently i found the courage to breakup with my boyfriend i blocked him everywhere he keeps texting me from new accounts and i keep getting weak i keep thinking about him and imagining our future i guess a reason for being weak is that i will be in an arranged marriage by 22 years old in pakistan my boyfriend is serious about marrying me but my family will not agree on a love marriage plus my boyfriend makes me cry feel ignored and makes me feel alone school is another kind of stress i am facing with too many assignments i have breakdowns every now and then no food or groceries at home and i need to save money to pay for school i am starving crying having exams and assignments due i am so pathetic that i do not have the courage to end myself i am heartbroken hurt and a loser should i just go back to my boyfriend if i do not i will end up in pakistan with my toxic family and i will have a kid by 23 years of age and will be a maid for free

1,whether i live or die the world will remain unaffected i will not be missed by more than the two people who i depend on people will continue to justify lifes arbitrary and meaningless cruelty with fantastical explanations they will continue to center their lives around those fantastical explanations by chance of birth some people will continue to live great lives and others will continue to suffer the lucky ones will go through life engaged and curious and the rest will gradually be beaten down by rigidity conformity or cruelty the endless toxic and useless discourse that has come to define online life will not cease the universes countdown to extinction will not stop babies will continue to be born into abuse never having a chance people will continue falling in love every kiss taunting my lonely time on this earth in an effort to fight against meaningless absurdity people will continue to hate and wage war billions of farm animals will continue being bred into existence with all their capacity to feel pain and terror intact only to live cramped and miserable lives that end in systematic slaughter romantics will continue to write music and poetry in an attempt to offset the suffering that has come before them and will continue to come after i cannot take this anymore we were all born into hell the lucky ones are the ones who are naive enough to roll their eyes at the preceding sentence i cannot believe i was born with the capacity to feel so much only to be burned and tortured for such a long time as to only have the negative feelings left intact i cannot believe someone with so many hopes and dreams has no grace bestowed upon him only the same oblivion that everyone is forced to face sooner or later i cannot do this anymore i want to scream but no one will listen i cannot believe the level of helpless agony that so many of us are forced to endure why just fucking why i have not felt loved and safe in 10 years since i was 17 that is not an exaggeration i cannot fucking believe this is my life love used to be my hope my north star but in the words of daughters love is a disgusting thing love is a disgusting thing and the reason it is disgusting is because it is the trick that continues to propagate this cursed existence
1,finals and college applications are feeling like too much i am fully aware that every student encounters stress around the time of finals but i am completely overwhelmed honestly i feel cheated as well all my other friends in public school are skating by in all their classes talking about how they never have homework how their finals are so easy etc they go out live it up on the weekends and spend time with friends senior year is supposed to be my time to have fun the last chance to be a kid before going off to college i am stuck at an insanely rigorous private school that assigns me hours upon hours of homework every night and even more over the weekend finals are cumulative meaning students are responsible for every detail of everything we have learned this year i could understand the reasoning for giving cumulative finals if broad concepts were being tested however it is not just broad concepts it is every date and every battle about which we have learned in history it is every problem we have done in math and the same for every other subject it is all an unbelievable amount of material being required and i do not truly feel like i can manage it to make matters worse i am currently right on the line between letter grades doing well on my finals will pull me up and doing poorly will keep me down i would not normally be so stressed about finals but they are a kind of make it or break it thing at this point especially because certain colleges require my first semester transcript i just finished applying to the honors program at the college i will most likely be attending but i have been so swamped with work all the rest of my life that i am not even sure i even want to embark on something else challenging i hear college is the place you make all your true friends find yourself and everything else like that i just fail to even comprehend this idea because all school has ever posed is stress it feels like all my life has ever posed is stress anyone who survived a rigorous and stressful high school experience please tell me i am going to make it i expect the best of myself and hate myself when i cannot deliver i lose my head when i get too stressed and i do not even feel like i know what i am doing anymore
1,if you guys have been experiencing this probably best to tell someone about it i have been under tremendous stress lately with work my car which i fucked up backing out of my driveway and my relationship and lately i have been having more and more nasty thoughts that are not really normal for me to have i consider myself a down to earth dude with a lot of good hobbies and friends that keep my mind occupied but the amount of stress i have been having has changed the way i think and behave in public for example i have been socially checked out for the past couple of months something that people have been pointing out to me recently its caused me to lose track of my schedule and i have gone back into having recurring episodes of severe depression and i am smoking cigarrettes on the dl also not normal of me worst of it all has been my thoughts where i would randomly without any provocation think about the most fucked up things i could do to someone or something i think its important to note these things because i feel like i am not the only one in this position either and as a person that struggles with mental health i know its important to at least put your thoughts on text no matter how embarrassing ill list a few specific examples of what some of these thoughts have been i was driving down a freeway and thought about running off a bridge at 65 mph as well as running over pedestrians on the sidewalk without any feelings i thought about shmacking my grandmas head with a frying pan for no fucking reason i was on the line about deciding whether or not to push my friend into a lake when i know he cannot swim well those are just a few of those thoughts but i love my family and friends and would absolutely never voluntarily put anyone in danger i do not exactly know if these thoughts are a byproduct of my stress levels or if i am a straight psycopath again i really want to reiterate that i am a good person and its super abnormal for me to think something as horrific as what i described if you also have these thoughts you should dm me or even comment because no matter how embarrassing its honestly relieving my stress right now just typing this out thanks for understanding i am going to post this elsewhere as well to hopefully help more people too
1,old heartbreaks can eventually just be nice memories i am sure that this does not apply to every situation but it made me happy to think about today i thought about my first girlfriend this morning it was actually because of hearing a song we used to listen to all the time just driving around our little home town we were both 16 when we met and we were together for nearly 2 years it was a classic story she got into college in a different state i could not afford to go to college yet we planned to stay together long distance and it lasted about 3 months breaking up with her ruined both of us at the time of course for a few months that first person you fall in love with does a number on you i was pretty miserable for a while for years when i thought about it it would make me a little sad especially if i was single at the time then i really never thought about it at all this was probably the first time i thought about her in as long as i can remember maybe years i am 30 now this time though i did not feel sad at all everything i remembered was a happy memory the first time we kissed which was the first time either of us had kissed anyone doing absolutely everything together sneaking out just to see each other for a few minutes climbing an old fire tower in our town laying out in a field under the stars together falling asleep together for the first time carrying her around for no reason planning all the trips we would never end up going on together also just that overwhelming feeling of wanting to be near someone and the joy i would feel when her car would pull up or when she would walk out of her front door to meet me it is all just nice fun stuff and it does not really matter to me anymore that it did not work out and i do not really remember the painful part of it ending i am just glad it happened it was probably the best part of my childhood and young adult years and you cannot get that back in my mind she was the most beautiful smartest and funniest person i had ever met and i could not believe when all those feelings were reciprocated even if it did not last we loved each other not everyone gets to experience being in love with someone at 17 its such a pure and simple thing and i think i am pretty lucky
1,how do i come back from a joke gone poorly i am too lazy to make an alt acc or whatever last night i went to dinner with some of my coworkers who i was becoming pretty good friends with i will say this now i was a little under the influence over the past few weeks i have been dealing with financial struggles the passing of my grandpa who was my last grandparent alive and not being able to leave my house and go hang with other people back to last night things were going okay and we were all having fun i think my one pal and i always crack i guess you could say edgy jokes he was like oh yeah by the way guys me is a violently racist person it took me a good 3045 seconds to realize what he said and all my friends were like me what the fuck dude are not going to say anything i tried to explain that i infact was not and that it was a joke but it was too late about 5 min later we were still cracking jokes and we were talking about our newest coworker she was not with us my edgy friend asked what ethnicity she was and i said she was african american because i genuinely thought she was even though i have only interacted with her like 3 times my very liberal manager got up and said dude are you fucking retarded she had never said something like this to me before so i was caught off guard my mind was scrambling and i was thinking ok what is she then she has to be one of the other ones ethnicities well my stupid monkey brain said oh one of the other ones out loud and everyone just looked at me at this moment i knew i was fucked and there was no way of helping myself over the next couple hours most of them did not really talk to me at all and i could tell that they were genuinely disappointed in me and i felt all of this guilt engulf me i sent a long message in our group text and only one of them responded saying yeah man the stuff you said rubbed us the wrong way and we are not the audience for that after that they have yet to talk to me and i have to go work later and i cannot get myself to cheer up at all do you guys have any advice tldr i made a ignorant and slightly racist comment while under the influence at dinner with my coworkers and they are very angry at me and are not responding to my apologies
1,for the first time in 4 years i feel hopeful for what the future holds for me i have never really been hopeful for anything and if i have been it is never lasted for more than an hour my expectations have always been at rock bottom to protect myself from disappointment this has worked well for me with minimal hurt from hoping too much but i do not need to do that anymore i do not necessarily know why but since june i have been looking forward to waking up every morning actually i know why it is because the belief that i had to die to feel at peace has been proven wrong completely wrong it is so reassuring to know it is possible to be happy and alive at the same time for the past few years i have been wallowing in my depression i feared death but at the same time craved it so as foolish as i was i tried failed and regretted backing out for about 8 months mainly because i was now on peoples watchlist i had a fear of pills for a while just the thought of them made my stomach twist and turn i would constantly lay in bed stay up late to wake up minutes before the bus i was convinced that there was nothing left for me so i acted impulsively if i was going to go i was going to go out with a bang i fractured my hand had a scrap with my bastard of a parent attempted planned another but at the same time i desperately hung on i did not really want to die no one really does a close friend of mine dragged me out i will always admire and appreciate her for having the patience to deal with me she let me stay and i have realized her family is the polar opposite of mine calm and quiet majority of the times full of fun laughter they do not raise hands or lace poison in their words i did not know that this was possible for me to be happy for more than an hour for me to be a part of a household where my contribution is appreciated and needed where my mental illness is not a myth where my feelings do not have to be locked away i feel so validated and unconditionally loved i want to start getting professional help to better myself i feel like with this i can keep pushing forward that i will keep standing up after falling down no matter how many times that will be i do not know why but i feel happy to be here
1,do you ever feel like depression set you back a few years i am a sophomore in college right now and i am constantly surrounded by wise people people who did things with their lives in high school and did not waste it away crying starving themselves neglecting their work they were able to partake in extracurriculars in spite of nervousness or not being nervous at all they were able to accomplish things efficiently without attention or memory issues they were able to make friends without poor social cues i had friends who manipulated me and threatened to commit suicide everyday and even then i never had positive influences to help me my parents were so busy with work that since my youth i was always alone at home i have trouble having fun i cannot emotionally feel like a happy person it is always forced it does not come naturally to me so people did not like people like me i am too lazy to write this but basically i feel so bitter i wish i did more so i could show off my potential but nope i was not certain of myself ever i am trying to improve but my past latches onto me sigh edit i have something to add first i am very happy to see that some people can relate to at least the topic sentence of this post we all feel like we were taken back by years because of some shitty stuff in my past i also did not get to finish writing this because i had not the energy to finish but there were moments where i stopped eating showering and brushing my teeth for very long periods of time i also hid my feelings all the time when people used to say you do not understand it would hurt so much because i really did in some way or so i thought i had speech therapy in middle school and general therapy in high school but i was never very honest because i was always afraid of the consequences i feel a little bit of pride i guess saying this but i feel like i am an example of someone who hid all their feelings and just wants it all like all vomited and shat and sweated and cried out of me until i can remove it completely nowadays i struggle to even read sometimes i just dont have the strength but i try i do say though writing this was therapeutic because i am severely overwhelmed saying this but thanks for reading
1,the cancer has spread to my liver well it is most likely the cancer anyways the doctors like to make me feel better by saying there is a chance it will be benign but so far it never has been every test has come back as bad news which just leads to more tests and more uncertainty the pain in my hips has come back and knowing i have a fresh mass in my liver that is already 5cm acrossit freaks me out it was not there when i had surgery in the beginning of may which means it is spreading and fast i was feeling ok for a couple weeks but the pain is coming back and i am scared for the abdominal pain to come backthat was the worst the hurt in my hip is like a constant dull ache that is always bothering me but the pain in my abdomen was like always feeling like puking but never actually puking along with stabbing pain if i moved wrong i do not want that again i even talked to my doctor about going back to work and she said go for it if i feel okay but what if i do not actually feel okay what if it just keeps getting worse will i ever be back to normal will i be able to go back to school in the fall will i be able to finish my degree or will the cancer completely derail the one goal i had finally started to crawl towards i have a biopsy scheduled in 2 weeks and i am scared for that my first biopsy did not give conclusive results that lead to 4 months of waiting for surgery because no one thought it was serious i am terrified of that happening again i am just so full of uncertainty and i am scared and i feel like i am not valid for feeling any of it people have it worse than i do so my brain tells me i do not get to be upset but i am but i do not want to be i am conflicted i am upset i want to sleep so i do not have to feel forgive the rant but thank you if you read through my woes anyways edit i posted this without much thought last night in the middle of a break down and went right to sleep afterwards i cannot believe the amount of support people have shown mei am in shock you all are so nice and lovelyit definitely helps the old psyche when so many people affirm that i am allowed to be upset so thank you to everyone who has commented or upvoted these little moments of support help so much sometimes thank you
1,should i tell my father about my chronic stomach pain due to stress about 2 years ago i started having terrible stomach pains all the time which were usually worsened by any kind of stress that i faced throughout the day last year my father became very worried about this and decided to take me to the doctor to see what could be causing it my bowel movements were regular i avoided foods that i was allergic to and the doctor could not find anything wrong but i did not mention my stress to her at the time after this visit i took a blood test and an ultrasound but i seemed to be in perfect health then we saw a gi doctor and i finally decided to ask if my stress levels were part of the because of my stomach pain after i explained the situation a little more he told me that my issues were definitely stress related and that i should visit a psychiatrist he also advised me to start taking therapy i actually used to take therapy for something other than stress i had been regularly engaging in self harm and fallen into the deep pits of depression about a year before my stomach pains had started so when my father found out he asked me to start taking therapy it worked great and i loved going but i think we all know that therapy is pretty expensive my father has a good stable job and is paid well enough but my mother does not have a job and he has two children we try not to spend too much money but continuing to get therapy on his salary is just impossible so i stopped taking therapy after we moved cities my father started getting paid around 20000 more per year after the move and we started living in an area where rent is much more reasonable a few months ago my father told me that he wanted me to start taking therapy again if my stomach pain would not go away but i knew that he would still have a difficult time affording it i also knew that he was having a hard time sleeping at night because of the stress that i was causing him i love my father a lot and i do not want to trouble him any more than i already do so i started lying to him and saying that my stomach does not hurt anymore i thought i would be able to keep up the lie but the pain seems to only be getting worse what should i do
1,finals week bit of a rant just wanted to know if anyone else felt the same excuse the word vomit i have been up since 6 30 am for an exam it is finals week and anxietystress is at an all time consistent high on top of that our family puppy has been great but i think my school anxiety has trickled in to me worrying over him more than i should and i constantly get overwhelmed with all the things i have to get done i cannot even enjoy food because i am always thinking too much and get caught up in the stress of school i literally was eating and saw my puppy sleeping and i immediately said wow he is depressed is not he when he is just sleeping i went out to get food totally fine no problem as soon as i got home it hit me again with all the stuff i have to do the pandemic has 1000 affected my mental health especially recently where i do not get any enjoyment of stuff at home because i am always in front of a damn computer screen i used to see home as a place to leave behind stress from school and now i see home as the place where i do everything and there is no distinction between relaxing and school but the one thing i can hold onto is that it is going to pass all of this is going to pass at some point the brain is just rewiring itself because of the situation happening globally it is going to be okay the only way to eat an elephant is one bite at a time if this spoke to anyone out there feel free to let me know how you are feeling how are you coping and if there is any puppy pros in the crowd please let me know what you did to help release some of that feeling of wanting constantly to helicopter over them during times of stress when i feel relieved i do not feel any need to check on him constantly or obsess over little things around the house just when i am overwhelmed and then i do not get anything productive done anyways i always remind myself i am not alone and neither are you even talking to strangers about it can be soothing in a way just a little reminder that there is someone else out there in your boat during such a difficult time my counselor said to normalize what is normal during an abnormal time period and also do not forget to tell your pets you love them
1,miniburnouts hi i am dealing with a hardtograsp psychological problem the pattern is somewhat like this i am always highly stimulated sometimes i am tempted to work too hard and end up in some sort of miniburnout this happens about once a week and leaves me foggy and unmotivated dopaminedepleted for about 2 days i have a lot of atypical adaptations built in that are related to this when i am overly excited it inhibits me probably the same way that anxious people are inhibited but i do not feel any anxiety i am often hardly aware of how stimulated i am sometimes i am somehow compelled to go into super sayan mode work my ass off try to complete my whole todo list in one daythis pretty much instantly triggers a miniburnout this also happens when i drink just one cup of coffee except when i am socially active then i can take all the stimulants i want and be fine weird this state has gone on for about 2 years and i still have not been able to make sense of it maybe there is a blindspot somewhere anyway other than perhaps someone being able to label this thing for me i have a question about a specific solution i have in mind my defense mechanism for high stress is usually to tone it down through reframing my situation as easy meditating ignoring my todo list etc now i have a suspicion that this miniburnout is emotional or motivational in nature that i am not actually chemically depleted but that there is a ton of emotional baggage that needs to be cleared each time that i go down or alternatively that i am just fed up with how little progress i am making given the effort i put in if this is true it requires a whole different approach it would involve not changing the arousal but the valence of my emotions reframing my high stress as excitement instead of anxiety maybe that will make the stress less chronic but i am afraid that this will just put me further in the wrong place because it will involve kicking down habits that reduce arousal thereby increasing it and that would be extremely highcost for i have been in a very very bad place as a result of burnout could anyone shine their light on this any progress on this problem would be major for me thank you
1,my mom keeps laughing at me whenever i get upset so today i got really upset because my mom called the electric company a long time ago and they came today about our bill my mom denied it was us who called he asked the other neighbors and he was asking for the apartment that called them about the bill he said that they had low income so they were trying to see if they can figure out what to do with the bill or something along those lines so my mom tried telling them that after using the heater once in the winter the bill was 300 after hearing that i told my mom about it we have low income because my mom is the only one working and she does not have her green card yet our dad also left us so it is harder for her to clean houses for money so anyways i told my mom that we could have saved money she said it does not matter i told her that i know that my mom cannot earn money that is why i always try to find ways to save money i am only 12 and i am aware going through puberty so i get mad easily i was shouting back asking her why she never tried to save money she does not respond and starts laughing at me i have been getting stressed out a lot this past week and my mom just does not help she laughs whenever i get stressed she tries to communicate to others about useless things with her extremely broken english and she keeps using her money on useless things overall i am fine with all the other things but i just get way more stressed when my mom keeps laughing at me when i get upset it is unlikely for me not to start crying when she starts laughing she then starts laughing at me even more i am having second thoughts on her being a nice person i am starting to think that she bullied others all i know is that my mom fought with other kids to be at a higher level of a clique a leader i remember her telling me about a mark on her back from fighting i know i went off topic a bit while typing this but i am just really annoyed that my mom laughs at my stress and calls me insane for shouting i have tried many times asking her not to laugh at me while i am stressed out it never works i have no idea how to make her stop i was wondering if anyone could suggest anything to make my mom listen
1,how to survive christmas sorry in advance for any mistakes english is not my first language for as long as i can remember christmas has always been a time of very intense feelings for me i have always felt the christmas holidays to be an overwhelming and stressful period of time basically the exact opposite of what holidays are supposed to be like my parents also reinforced this by making the christmas stuff last for days by this i do not only mean the actual celebration but also the seemingly endless time you have to spend with the same people over and over again including the same old political arguments and the forced gatherings of relatives you literally never have to see except for this time of the year even without all this family stress christmas itself the beginning of a new year and also my birthday also happening at the beginning of january are times when i feel low no matter what happens i always feel like i have not even nearly accomplished as much as i would like in my life and i have never even once in my life felt as happy as you probably should feel for christmas or your birthday i feel like there is this mutual agreement all over the world that this is the time of the year the time of your life and simply the time where you should feel best and some magic miracles happen and your life upgrades itself to next level i know it is unrealistic and probably an unhealthy way of thinking but it seems like subconsciously this thought is stuck with me this whole thing stresses me out intensely every year but this year it is especially bad or maybe it is been that bad the years before and i just pushed it out of my mind the point is it is gotten to me physically and i have had a cold for basically a month now and the last few days my backs been extremely stiff and sore which is something that usually never happens i am panicking intensely even thinking about going home to my parents place for christmas next week and i do not know to get through these daysweeks without feeling like i will go insane any minute i hope this is the right sub for this problem and i appreciate you reading this far and if you have any tips for making christmas a bit easier even better

1,opening up too much hi everyone i need so advice or words of encouragement i already feel bad enough with myself i feel like i have made a mistake and potentially messed up something good i recently met this guy on tinder i have never been a fan of the app and my conversations do not usually last long with anyone but this guy and i clicked instantly we both want the same things are very similar and there seems to be a lot of chemistry where i am from we are in lockdown we started talking two weeks ago and have not met yet been talking everyday pretty much all the time i had some bad things happening the last two days my dog got very sick and had to take her to emergency vets i was distraught and terrified of losing her then my parents told me they are divorcing anyway so that plus my depression bipolar anxiety and other mental health issues i have found the last two days really rough so i opened up to this guy he is been really understanding comforting and has really been the best however i opened up about some serious stuff about my past overdosing and other things i feel like i have opened up too much i have extreme anxiety i possibly have messed this up i know we have not been talking long and it terrifies me that i will lose him because i just dumped all my shit on him i did not mean to i was just being honest and he encouraged me to talk about it but i do not think he knew how serious it would be i told him i would talk to him tomorrow because i did not want him to think i was doing this to make him feel bad for me or for attention i have pushed away people after opening up i guess it all was too much for them to handle he just said oh and reassured me i was being silly and it was okay but that was it i asked him if he was mad and he said no i asked if we were good and he said yes after that he just said good night and that he hoped i felt better and had a good sleep have i messed this up my anxiety is telling me so and i do not want to mess it up i regret so much opening up i knew it would be too much but he insisted and do not think he was ready to hear it all has anyone been in a similar situation thank you if you have made it this far through my post

1,about beauty well i have this little monologue about the word i love and hate sometimes i think about what beautiful is who taught you the readerwho taught me what beautiful isall i see is that i am far from beautiful and those instagram people i see are breathtakingly beautiful sometimes it makes me cry looking at them so i do not social media hasat least on me burned those two or three stereotypes of perfect beauty and of course i am like most p eople not themi wonder if i was those having popularly celebrated features if i know myself correctly would not have been writing this but really what is beauty what is physically attractive i have many famous and normal people i find beautiful but its not me its just not me because i do not have that eyes that jawthat body that face every time i look in the mirror i try to make the reflection look but i cannot it does not stop looking anything but ugly i use things to get that perfect skin hair and everythingbut nothing works i cannot look at the mirror without despising what i see i would not mention my insecurities because it makes me feel like people will be out to get me even they people who love and care about me beyond physical attraction i never tell them because even when they do not care i do not want any human to see and take notice my loved ones try to tell me that external beauty does not matter and that i am still pretty nevertheless but i cannot believe them when i try to people are obsessed with their beauty and i am obsessed with my ugliness why am i so shallow for myself why am i kind to everyone but me at the end of the day i hate to admit it but i wish i looked like those girls i want to be the universally accepted beautiful anyone would tell me i am one of the kindest and empathetic person they have met in a while but i am shallow to me i am unkind to me frankly i hate me i am not beautifuland i believe i cannot change that i hate me and i cannot change that i hurt everyday when i see myself but i guess i can learn to live with that i am just okay because i have beautiful souls that care for me guess i will keep writing sharing these hateful monologue to myself thank you for reading
1,i feel like i ruin everything around me bit of a long post but i just got out of a really bad relationship awhile ago i e had bad relationships since 201516 she basically broke me mentally refusing to get help for her own struggles pushing marriage kids i am not ready for any of that granted if i did or dated somebody that had kids i would help raise them and whatnot i just think i would make a terrible father figure which led to the girl i am currently talking to it is really hard to read her at least to me i am not pushing we both want to see where it goes she says she has feelings and all but i really cannot tell we have gone on a couple dates everything seemed to go well she is honestly the bright spot i needed but i cannot read her i try not to push or ask the same things over and over again i am scared to touch her granted i have kissed her and hugged her a couple of times and she seemed ok with it but i do not know if she is or not i also feel like i bother her every time i ask something to her she says i am fine but am i i am not used to being told what i am doing is fine i do not want to do the wrong thing she always thanks me when i help her i have told told her i feel like i do not do enough i feel like i am pushing the whole 9 yards the last thing i want to do is ruin something that is possibly a good thing and i feel like i am yet she always says i am fine this all led up to a week where i would go out at night drive to an abandoned bridge that i have been to alot and would just stand there nothing suicidal i just wanted to clear my head and try to get my bearings there is been nights i have literally fallen asleep crying because i feel like i am ruining everything somehow i have broke down at work a few times i have tried not to blow her up too much i know she works and i know she gets tired easily i just do not know if i am doing the right thing or if i am just blinding myself to whatever it is she is trying to tell me if there is anything then there is the what ifs everything i have dealt with in previous relationships cheating lying stealing using emotional abusei hate themit causes me to overthink and panic i do not know what to do
1,how do i recover my creativity after stress do not know if this is the right place for this but i have searched other subs and this seems like the best place to me i have been through a lot of stress and maybe some undiagnosed depression in the last two years between the death of a close loved one job and financial stress severe relationship problems health issues and a bad living situation i existed just to go to work where my coworkers helped me destress and laugh but slept until i had to leave and came home just to get in bed again i am a creative person with a lot of drive to make things and this used to give me a lot of purpose in my life but during this time i would stopped doing almost anything but watching comedy specials on tv i was finally on the upswing of all that and feeling more like myself and finally got back into my writing which is my passion but my stress threshold is still fucked up so when in march i felt forced to quit my sewing job over a heated argumentfight with my boss it broke me again not as bad as last year but i lost the routine i would just settled into and most of the writing drive i had i have lost i worked there for six years and had a strong role and responsibilities that i had integrated as part of my identity that job felt like who i am i had a comfortable lax second job already that is now my main income and i am fine there and once again starting to come back out of that darkness i am able to do some crafting in bed but still spend most of my time with the tv on i am also getting a gentle morning routine going and that helps but the big problem is my creative drive i want to create things i am investing money in a voice recording set up and i want to narrate and write and read i am wasting time cross stitching for hours every night while i binge shows i do not really care about when i have perfect chunks of time to do the things i crave getting back into the motivation is not there how do i do it how do i get back into things i love when i have finally reached the other side of the stress and how do get myself strong again after so much so that the next thing to come along does not break me all over again
1,if someone could help me out after having read my rent i would he grateful and if not that is fine as well hello people my life feels at this moment worthless i would not mind someone taking it away at least having said that that is out of the way school started again in my final year now i turned 18 the beginning of the end of school but because of complications mental health i had to redo a year a while ago all my friends have left now and i feel very stuck and alone everywhere in school with my family i am not the person i was during my vacation i have changed again to the back old stressed and scared me and i hate it it is hard because i just do not want any people around me yet i also feel the need for someone but i cannot bring up the motivation or will power to do so and i am in this constant state of not really being there i do not see any way how to build up a friendship with someone i see at school for example while i definitely need such a thing everyone seems so not on the same level and i think well that is not going to work out besides that minor stuff stresses me i am no longer mindful in any way i feel so god damn hopeless and so scared for the future so immense scared that i will fuck up i cannot even go to bed simply because every part in my brain wants to stay awake no matter how tired i am i try to stay awake until i cannot no more because i have no motivation to fall asleep and start the day over again i really do not know what to do at this point i am still on a waiting list for therapy and as it seems it will for sure take another month if i am lucky most likely 3 months everything in me just surches for escapes it is sleep deprivation or i grab alcohol while i pledged to not drink i can be way more impulsive than normally it is weird all this combined with moments of derealization i do not know what is going on with me the last weeks but i will not be able to continue in this way i feel a stranger in my own body in this world with everyone could someone please explain me why this all happens and what could help or yeah i do not really know i do not even know if this is the right place for this post
1,i do not feel like i am suicidal enough to warrant help but at the same time every time i do feel suicidal it hits me like a ton of fucking bricks like right now my heart is telling me to go jump off the fire escape the scene keeps replaying in my head while i lie in bed motionless and numb i feel like a fake depressed person because i avoid my responsibilities and just play video games or do anything meaningless to fill time it just makes me feel like a lazy person and i often think i am just using my depression as an excuse to feel lazy and that i deserve the suicidal thoughts i want to admit myself to inpatient but again i feel like i would just be taking up space as a fake depressed person even though sometimes i really cannot stop thinking or fantasizing about killing myself i just do not want to experience the stress of school anymore i lost all my friends i am also scared of leaving my partner to fend for themselves and i do not know if my school would even permit a leave of absence anyways also covid of course every time i think about or try to do homework my brain goes into suicide mode even though i love learning and what i learn about i am so far behind in my classes because maybe i am just lazy and not actually depressed i do not know it is not like anyone will see this i just need to talk about it i feel so nauseous small edit i went to sleep last night and am only now checking reddit after class and i i am so blown away by the supportive responses and the support offers i have gotten when i said i thought no one would see this i genuinely meant it and so to be able to read everyone is comments even the ones of people who are in the same spot it has given me more hope i feel so warm and fuzzy inside i felt i had lost all my friends to my depression and i have not felt this feeling in my chest in a while and i cannot overstate how flattered i am i would cry if i could i am going to try to reply to people you all really helped me last night and today i woke up and it is a bright sunny day i can hear the cars and the people outside i am still sad and unstable but i feel hope in my chest so thank you really white_heart
1,i just cannot seem to handle this anymore i am a sophomore in high school i get good greats participate etc etc but i feel so over worked this semester i am part of the school show and this is our tech week i feel like it should be a friday but its only tuesday i had two projects due yesterday for my honors humanities courses neither of which i was able to get finished due to the tech week on top of that i play jv tennis first year do scouting 5th year take tap dancing lessons 11th year and practice both piano 12th year and violin 8th year and not to brag but i do them all quite well i run all a s in high school with the occasional b in math but i just feel like my way of life is falling apart around my ears and that is just the first level of stress the second level is both stress and fear myself and a group of people have been running a in depth study of the death of michael hastings and its finally getting to me i myself have poured in over 600 hours on this project since mid december acting as a defacto leader for the group since we have no proper administration we are intending to go public relatively soon and its finally started to hit home just how deep we are into this project you could say that this project is the root of all my stress so the logical thing to do would be to leave the project quietly and that is where we hit the problem if i where to back down from this now not only would it have been a tremendous waste of my time it would also be similar to if i saw someone preform a fatal hit and run i saw the licences plate got a picture of it but then decided to not give the picture to authorities i have always been the kind of person who manages their emotions well that is why i am an admin on several discord servers i do not discriminate and i do not favor any parties but as of late i feel like i am always on the verge of breaking down stopping whatever i am doing and just crying until i cannot anymore i have not quite been able to pinpoint why i want to cry so hard but its getting to the point where i am occasionally tearing up over the simplest phrases like how is your day going please someone help
1,i think my life is destined to end in suicide my depression never goes away even though i have cycled through different therapists and medication for 7 years now everything is much worse than before the slightest inconvience makes me think of ending it all i have tried 3 times and obs failed d i am only 20 and i feel like an old man who has seen it all i have had insomnia since i was a child i cannot sleep for days sometimes it is fucked and when i do sleep i sleep like 18 hours and still feel tired it is very hard to keep up with my studies with this oh and i am not in college but still trying to finish high school it is not going well i have no job and right now have about 50 bucks to live until january after i payed my bills i have no friends strained relationship with family basically just my mom only child father left when i was a baby no one to talk to no one cares about me it is been like this all my life never had a single good relationship with anyone this all sucks but is not the why i think i will kill myself i know all of the things i could make my life go better but i just do not see it ever happening since my mental state never gets better i have already experienced one psychotic episode i feel constantly on the edge of sanity i simply cannot live like this much longer there is no help for me i have tried the help so many times already i think i will not make it to my next birthday but that is alright it will be a good thing for the world i already have violent fantasies of just going to a mall and shooting people it is best to end it before i harm somebody else i am not a good person and i will not be missed edit honestly wow i wrote this on like half brainpower before going to sleep just getting those thoughts that have plagued me recently out i did not think it would get this kind of response it was a nice suprise to wake up to since i really did not believe there was anyone that cared anymore i especially did not know that so many could relate to these kinds of thoughts this is the dark side of depression that people do not want to talk about all i can say is that i am still here for now fighting on another day
1,identity crisis easily influenced more concerned about others hi i never thought i would get to this point but i have been having an identity crisis for what feels like only 2 months but these things do not happen overnight i used to be consumed by my goals my grind growing up it was mostly me and my small circle but now that i have accomplished these things i have fallen into the worst depression of my life because these goals were not rooted in myself just there to prove a point i find myself more concerned with my friends lives comparing myself to what they are doing and checking my phone to ensure i am in constant communication with someone but not actually living my own life i am wildly indecisive and influenced for example switched from an in person class to an online class because of fear of a professor and conversations i had with someone forgetting that i only wanted to be in school if it was in person i use social media as a way to self harm watching others live the lives i want to i know more about what my ex and their friend group is doing then how to solve my problems i just feel so consumed by others and i do not know how to turn it off i feel as though i do not have interests anymore only consuming what is recommended i used to have pockets of the internet of the world that felt like mine but i do not anymore i am severely insecure happy for my friends on the outside jealous on the inside i am too old for this i do not know where to start it is both my goals and aspirations i need to improve but also myself and simply waking up in the morning eating cooking for myself organizing and taking care of myself i have a new therapist and have been doing a dialectical workbook but i still just feel so ashamed and disappointed in myself and i do not know how to get out of it i cannot really focus and my memory is fried i have a lot of support but that means nothing when on the inside you feel so lost behind and disconnected has anyone experienced this i know it is one day at a time but i need hope i also am running out of money which is a stressor and my health insurance barely covers anything i do not know what to do
1,apparently depression is just attentionseeking stupidity to people when i get like this i tend to google what i am thinking i googled one of the biggest things about myself why does making myself feel bad make me feel better super simple just a lack of better terms typical answers were things like you were abused as a kid and it became all you know nooe not it you need a therapist i do not want to pay someone just to tell me i have a problem i know i do self harm and suicide number typical i want to help by not helping so i will just leave the suicide hotline number instead then one of the answers is a long paragraph about how depression is just attention seeking you got everything your way when you cried as a kid so you are crying now in hopes that someone pities you they would called it stupidity and realizing you are just a serial attention seeker will make that stupidity go away it felt like a dagger was plunged into my chest when i read that surely no one agrees with that nope one of the top answers fuck when i cried as a kid because i did not get what i wanted i still did not get what i wanted i got spanked and sent to my room i do not want people to give me nice words on the contrary i would rather people be dicks to me selfloathing and such is a comfort feeling and i know that makes me selfish i harmed after that i do not cut myself or anything i am too much of a stupid fucking pussy i asphyxiate myself typically with a chord this time it was a long piece of plastic packaging that i wrapped around my neck i have written about this here in the past i have only recently come to the realization that i use it as a physical and psychological way to make myself feel awful and because harm rather than attempt to off myself i just do not know of this counts as anything more since it does not leave a scar it is probably just some silly dumb thing and nobody takes it seriously because i am just being a fucking baby yeah that well whatever here i am making a post because i am a serial attention seeker that should just keep all of this inside so i do not spread my stupidity silly me
1,recently told i may have mild depressionfeeling kind of horrible about it i have been seeing a therapist for anxiety and she recently told me that i may also have mild depression i told her basically that various aspects of my life sometime seem too hard for me to do and i just think about how it would be easier if i was not here but that i would never act on these thoughts because that would be horrible for my family that is when she told me i may have mild depression which really shocked and saddened me because i had never thought i had depression i had the wrong impression that depression across the board meant it was hard for you to get daily tasks done which has not been true for me in terms of school i had completed everything on time received high marks and worked extremely hard on my projects same goes with my internship but now school and my internship are over and i feel lost hopeless and like time is running out for me to do something successful with my life every job app i read seems daunting exhausting and soulsucking i tell myself i just cannot do it and i feel so horrible about it i have recently graduated and should feel proud and accomplished and while i know that i did well i do not see anything impressive about it i just feel like a failure kind of because the next steps are hard to initiate i am pretty sure i have dysthymia and may talk more about this with my therapist i have definitely had these hopeless feelings for more than 2 years i am afraid to tell my mom about this because i do not want her to be concerned but my therapist thinks putting me on an antidepressantanxiety meds will help me push through some things and i need to tell my mom this in order to get help as i am still on her insurance telling her would probably explain myself to her better i just feel kind of lost and never thought this would happen to me edit i am also hesitant to tell my mom about this because she is going thru something pretty stressful that concerns my sister right now and my mom had a panic attack about it last night i feel so stuck and will not be able to see my therapist for another 3 weeks
1,i never post anything in my family chat group because my rich and succesful brother overshares his accomplishments to an extreme amount and now i am the bad person my brother is in his 30s and he is rich and succesful exactly in the way society likes you to be healthy good looking long term partner big house and constantly overachieving at his job always getting promoted always looked for new challenges i have never seen him fail at something he has never been fired never had trouble making friends never been bullied never had trouble finding relationships i am in my twenties i have autism and adhd and my life is a mess i have never held a job longer than 6 months i lived with roommates during college but the pressure became to much and i had to move back home i have a small group of friends i am actually very happy with but i had huge social issues in the past and i am still definitely impaired in that area i am fighting hard to get my shit together now we have a shared family group chat and literally 90 of it is my brothers sharing his accomplishments it is a never ending stream of vacation pictures fancy work lunches promotions parties etc at least once a day often more he will be on vacation and post 20 pictures a day of what he is doing and how amazing everything is and of course my parents drool over it at some point i just started tuning out and do not even read it anymore they say instagram is bad for your self esteem but this is a million times worse i seriously cannot take another smiling vacation selfie anymore without wanting to punch a wall or hurt myself i truly want to be happy for their accomplishments and success but it just eats away at me and people comment on it too you never share anything you are not involved with the family i have talked about it before and basically got a response like well you could at least be happy for others yes i try it gets harder when the sharing never ever stops they make me feel like i am a bad person while all i am trying to do is preserve the last of my sanity and feeling of self worth before i go over the edge completely

1,my symptoms 15 years after burning out getting diagnosed with fatigue syndrome hey guys so a while back i did a post about the symptoms to look for when fearing burnout is around the corner link in the end of the post it was quite appreciated so thought i would do a little followup on how it is been going to recover and later also talk about how i lived that caused the burnout so i started with recording a video sharing all the symptoms i still live with more than 15 years after the crash not to make people feel sorry for me but because i want you to realize that there really is a cost to working 247 even if it is super fun and you feel like you have all the energy in the world like i did also i just want to say i love life and this experience has made me love it even more life is fragile cherish it link to the video now the video tells the story best but in short i still suffer from the following headaches on a daily basis if i strain my brain too much that is thinking too hard or too much i work with video editing right now so it could be me just working for 20 minutes this could also be caused by just thinking about something that stresses me or talking to a person for too long or when i feel the least amount of pressure if i work out and push myself just a little bit too much my body shuts down and it feels like i get the flu headache dizzy almost feverish feeling and i do not need to push hard to reach this deadlift is a given if i want this to happen memory loss hard time remembering things concentration difficulties and very low ability to concentrate dizzyness body that will not recover or heal woundsinflammation quickly graying hair or is it me getting old d emotional volatility crying a lot variating degree some days i feel normal some days it is like my body is in a standyby mood later in the week ill also release a video talking about how i lived that caused my burnout link to the first post i did on burnout fatigue syndrome symptoms to watch out for have a great day and stay on the right side of living d
1,every time i try to speak about my depression it sounds like a cliche so i keep it to myself i have tried to write something in this group so many times but i always delete it i have typed this exact sentence at least 4 times in the past but have not hit send so fuck it i am depressed i am dealing with it in my own way i listen to music a lot it takes me somewhere i just wish some songs were longer i take codeine to numb myself quite often i get a prescription every now and then as i have a condition which leaves me sore nearly all the time haha lifes a cunt i cannot cry i need to i feel it nearly everyday being right on the brink of tears but there is nothing there i do not know how it is possible to feel so emotionally empty and numb but at the same time feel everything every fucking thing i cannot breathe sometimes because of just how real it becomes so many thoughts running through my head at once every little insignificant detail about the most pointless fucked up things all at once and yet if you were to look at me you would see the most blank dull empty stare i am nothing and yet my mind tries to be everything haha such a broken piece of shit i think about hurting myself and dying a lot it used to scare me i remember the first time i genuinely thought about killing myself it scared me and it kind of felt good that that is how i reacted but that was ages ago it is so common now it is just part of what it is to be me insignificant hey thank you everyone for the response when i typed this out i did not expect it to get noticed and i almost did not send it again haha i just thought fuck it what have i got to lose but i am glad i did i cannot believe how many of you are in exactly the same position as me people who have commented or messaged me personally and said that i hit a personal note to them it means a lot to me i am sorry if i do not get around to replying to everyone you know how it is but believe me that i appreciate this more than you know in the future i will try to refrain from deleting my post instead of hitting send much love

1,so stressed that i was really crying about holes in the wall hi everyone just wanted to dump some thoughts out so i am taking organic chemistry over the summer i took ochem 1 earlier in the summer and managed to get an a however i am in ochem 2 now and it is really kicking my ass i am so stressed about it not only that summer session will not end until august 15th and my current apartment lease ends on july 31st my next lease at the new apartment does not start until august 23rd they will not let me move in early therefore i had nowhere to stay for the two weeks of august and i did not have a friend that had room available for me to crash at i booked a hotel last minute with my roommate she is in the same situation because she is taking ochem 2 as well and we have to move out in a few days so now i am stressed about moving out and making sure everything is in tip top shape so i can get my deposit back right i am also stressed because i will not have room in the hotel for all my stuff and i would not want to have it sitting in my car for so long i am racking my brains trying to find people to ask if i could store some stuff at their place i also have my ochem 2 exam on monday and i am barely grasping the concepts not only that my depression has been creeping back due to some repressed trauma resurfacing so it is just made everything ten times harder and honestly just more magnified i was taking everything down from the walls and was using this tube of some paste that my dad gave me to patch the holes from nailsscrews i had already finished patching up most of the holes until i finally read the tube and turns out that it is not made for walls i do not know anything about constructiony kind of stuff so i started freaking out i guess that that was my tipping point because i was really sitting on my floor having a crisis and crying over holes in the wall fast forward to now i have gotten the right paste needed to patch the holes and have finished going over them in retrospect everything is just funny at this point like i was really sitting there crying about holes in the wall haha
1,school stress hello everyone i am currently in my last year of high school and i am having a hard time dealing with it i live in eastern europe and in my country we have those big exams at the end of high school that are supposed to evaluate all the knowledge you have gained since grade 1 two exams are mandatory one in literature and the other one you can choose the subject yourself for my second one i chose physics and i am pretty confident with that however literature has always been a huge burden on mine and i find it extremely difficult to prepare for that exam i am beyond angered constantly that i have to deal with that subject i do understand that literature increases your knowledge about the world and teaches you how to support your arguments but the emphasis that is given on that exam by my teacher and parents is too big and i cannot do anything but hate the guts out of it now me being the perfect student raised by perfectionist parents i cannot even think about having low grades on that exam i study in a highly respected school where teachers can be pure evil to you i also have to prepare for my university entrance exams and work on a project of mine which stress me out even more at the end of the day i feel so drained out and like i have achieved nothing even though i have spent the whole day in school and preparing for exams i have started feeling physically unwell i used to work out a lot but now i do not have the energy to go out of my bed my blood pressure is very low and i have gained weight i have given up to emotional eating one too many times i want to shine for prom i want to look my best at the end of the school year and feel my best when real life hits me but i am scared that school will drain me out too much this is more of a rant post because i know the only way to fix the situation is by resting more i just cannot let myself rest my mind is constantly busy with my work anyways any help or advice or simple encouragement would be appreciated if you made it that far thank you for taking the time to read about my problems
1,life is stagnant hello reddit this is a basically a little vent and i apologise if it is in the wrong group i am happy to delete it if needed anyway i am almost 27 but i cannot help but feel like i am going on 72 this is not exactly a bad thing but realistically my life feels like it is never going to change in any major or meaningful way ever again i graduated from college and cannot afford more education nor i do not have enough money to even save up for a home i do have enough to split the cost of a cozy apartment with my partner which we do and we intend to remain child free however we do have a lovely cat honestly it feels like the only other major thing we could do is get married and even if we did we would not make it some grand ordeal we would probably quite literally just go to city hall together and then maybe go out for a nice lunch and call it a wedding please note that neither of us want it to be a big deal for many reasons and what i described would actually be ideal if we ever did even get married outside of that i do not really even have any talents hobbies passions or interests that i really find interesting enough to pursue further athough i am content with that it just adds to the atmosphere of stagnation but what fun is it forcing yourself to get good at something if you have no interest or motivation to do so i also do not have many friends nor do i enjoy being around people or crowds very much but even if i did i do not think the odds of me randomly meeting some dear new friend that will magically change my life forever are very high i am used to friends walking away from me after a while actually and only really have one or two friendships that have stood the test of time i guess the last thing worth mentioning is that i love travelling but it is really hard to afford that and fit it in plus you cannot really go far right now due to the delta variant does anyone else relate to any of this if anyone has any tips tricks or advice of how to break up the monotony i would be happy to hear it thank you very much for reading
1,my best friend is severely depressed and quit her meds cold turkey and is not acting like herself tw i do not know how to help her we have been best friends for years we even loved together as roommates for quite a few she has struggled with depression basically her whole life i have always been a support system for her and i thought i had seen her bad episodes i knew her when she almost made an attempt but i have never seen anything like this unfortunately we do not live together any more but i try to visit or talk on the phone as much as possible and she changed she is still honest to me about her symptoms for the most part which i appreciate as it makes it easier for me to help her but i do not know what to she has been suicidal the past three months isolating her self from friends and family only talking to me because i make her and that was hard to do she has not been eating and has been nearly fainting at work as a result she has no regard for future consequences she was fine with the potential of going to jail she is not keeping up with basic life necessities and is completely reliant on her boyfriend to survive it is not an abusives relationship he really cares about her but i believe they may be codependent she stated that her dissociation and suicidal thoughts have gotten worse so she decided to quit her meds last week she was on a very high dose and was on this led for over a year not something you can just quit without talking to a doctor when she was really down i sent her the numbers to some local crisis lines and she got mad at me saying she cannot afford to be hospitalized i told her they are just numbers to talk and are free they cannot hospitalize you but she did not want to hear it i do not know what do in the last bad period a few years ago where she almost attempted i was able to get her to go to therapy and it was really helping for a while but now she is isolating herself from even her therapist i am absolutely terrified that i am going to get a call that i was too late and that she is gone is there anything i can do
1,losing my house but i am going to be okay dear kind souls of reddit i am furious and under a huge amount of stress right now but i am going to be okay i would appreciate some words of wisdom and good vibes going my way i bought a mobile home on its own lot in 2016 i got the home inspected prior to purchasing it and i got house insurance and title insurance after i moved in i began to have problems with the water line freezing and breaking every winter i have spent around 4000 in repairs over the past two years and i think i have finally solved the problem my sewer stopped working properly in march of this year and i have had to dismantle most of the sewer underneath the house to solve the problem the plumber and i put a camera down and we found an unknown blockage somewhere close to the street i ended up having to dig up my driveway break the sewer and put the camera throughonly to find that the sewer is clean the sewer cleaner said that it was probably frozen and he has been to my house to thaw the sewer when the previous owners owned it in order to fix the broken pipe the plumber is going to have to dig down underneath the mobile home to connect to the iron sewer that is under there and in order to do this i will have to completely remove my house fix the sewer and then put my house back on my property the total bill for this will be around 10000 and it is at the point where i am ready to just get a new house i will be living paycheck to paycheck in a new house but i do not really have many options i would not have bought this house if i had known all of the problems that came with it and insurance will not cover any of this i have proof that the previous owners knew about the water line freezing but i have no proof that they knew anything about the sewer freezing i have not been able to sleep properly for several months i am under so much stress and i am furious i have been living in a hotel since march while i am still stuck paying a mortgage on property tax on a house that i cannot live in why does the world work this way
1,how do i see a psychiatrist over the past 6 years i often experience some phases lasting a few weeks to a few months and during those periods i cannot control my own emotions i get annoyed by every small thing and i keep crying throughout the day i also shut my friends out and do not feel like talking to anyone my appetite is also horrible and i do not eat a bowl of rice per day however it does not really affect my work and i am kind of a workaholic so people around me think i am normal hopefully i also always feel anxious and have had a few attacks recently i sought help from a local nonprofit organization and i have been going for free counselling for a year sometimes it helps but sometimes it does not so even though i am slightly better at managing these phases it still happens and affects my daily life my friends are forcing me to see a psych because they think i should get a diagnosis and meds and a part of me wants to because i want to get better but a part of me does not want to because i feel like it is a waste of money and it is going to be very difficult to convince my parents i am 17 yo singaporean i cannot go by myself because i am broke but my parents would not bring me because they are not even willing to bring me to a doctor for my physical issues i am experiencing nerve pain in my leg and if it continues i think i might become cripple any issuesickness i have they tell me to drink water and take a walk in the park as if that will make me magically feel better my parents fight multiple times everyday since i was young and there was a point of time they wanted to divorce and i think it has affected me so i always try to handle my own things myself i am also used to feeling depressed and anxious because i have been dealing with it just fine maybe not for the past 6 years i am thinking of telling my parents one more time but if it does not work i will have to starve save up and go by myself at a later time i honestly do not know what to do at this point i am so lost i feel like a crazy person sorry that this post is all over the place
1,feeling really useless i have always been a lurker or casual commenter here so here is my first post this lockdown has really exacerbated my depression though the culprit really is just being in a human society lol i feel isolated and alone i have opened up to a few people but i always end up sounding like a broken record and people say the same shallow things to console me so i just stopped talking to the people around me about feeling depressed my depression has led me to quitting my job trust me i was not far from getting let go so i quit before it got real bad i worked in a creative industry and the burnout feels permanent and i struggle to make money freelance pays so little and i am living off my life savings which is not much plus my art is not even doing well my works are ignored or even if i get a commission or freelance project i get paid less than minimum wage i have learnt to say no and i do negotiate my rates but the desperation has caused me to just do what i can to stay afloat i am almost 30 so being a crybaby about it just paints myself as immature to those around me never going to be able to afford a house car kids i do not have the capacity to handle most jobs but i did try my best before this most days i have sleep and tears for dinner i always forget to shower and brush my teeth my partner is stuck overseas indefinitely so i have lost my strongest support system the pain and loss i feel on a daily basis is unbearable some days i wish i had the guts to just end my life but instead i just wallow in my own sadness and filth i do not even know what would make me happy or at least dull the pain a little maybe some company and a bit of help here and there would make it a bit better but i know i would still feel dead inside and therapy i cannot afford it plus i know how therapists console people i am sure some of you relate to that thing you do where you have a rebuttal for every advice given i have been the therapist friend only just speaking from experience there is no point to this post just letting it out of my chest

1,if my depression spiked during the corona virus is it really depression or is it regular before the corona virus came i was suffering from being emotional numb this was because of things outside the virus but would take to long for me to explain however once the corona virus hit my mental health and self care dropped to the floor for me i was in the 7th grade the first time the corona virus was brought up and we went on lockdown during does first 6 months as i had my summer break to i played video games constantly with my friends from the uk as that was where i use to live and i was feeling great at the time because any kid at that age would love to not go to school for 6 months but whilst does months were going by i started realizing how unproductive my daily routine was and how bad my social skills were getting by this time i was in the 8th grade and now we actually had to do online school the only thing is me being in my room 247 for 6 months straight not doing anything but playing games and eating made my numbness way worse at this point i started not caring about life anymore and instead of living it would just feel like i am existing in a dead corpse it got so bad that i cheated on every online work i got and i did not feel bad at all and i still do not even when i had to go in person to do my final exams i knew i was going to fail them but still did not care now i am a freshman in highschool and i honestly cannot see myself doing anything but working at a fast food restaurant once i finish school bring abled to make friends has gotten so as to the point where i find it hard to speak to new people online to be honest highschool is not the worst i am glad i get to go in person because it is forcing me to speak to people however i have spoke to people about this depression and a lot of people say it is because of covid however i have not seen much people talk about it here in all honesty i am hoping that does people are right because i have had this numbness for 2 years now and i do not want it to be something i have to live with forever
1,i do not know how to stay positive with the chronic illness i am going through the last year but specifically it became severe the last 2 monthsi have severe gerd and lpr i have been in pain constantly my sleep has sucked it hurts to speak it hurts to breathe every meal i eat is basically a time bomb if i mess up and have anything remotely acidic even a minor ingredient my esophagus begins digesting itself and i can see sores develop that still have not healed it is hard to eat my diet is restrictive it has not helped i am young and healthier than most this is bullshit i am on the strongest meds they have to suppress acid ppi at this point i really think surgery is my only hope if you can even call it that reading stories online lots of people had great success but others have been left with the same symptoms it is been a recent dream to sing i want to be able to finally express myself especially considering my damaged childhood but my stupid body is falling apart and i cannot unless this gets fixed i know it can transform my life and it is what my heart is dying for but i need this to get fixed i do not know how to stay positive here anymore i do not know how people can do this deal with a chronic illness my social life is gone my days consist of watching tv trying to eat between the pain and counting down the day until the next doctor test hoping for an answer but they just say yep let us order this next test see you in 3 weeks mother fucker that and they act like surgery is not a good fix which translates to me as you have no hope i wish i were fat because then i could at least lose weight and get it fixed that way i am not going to live like this i want it all or nothing i need to be able to sing and this whole thing just makes me so mad and defeated and it pisses me off that i am so healthy but genetics or whatever just wants to ruin my life i thought i had maybe 20 more years of good health but right now it is looking really really bad i guess i just needed to vent or talk with somebody i do not know
1,should i stay please someone help me i am so conflicted i have 21f been with my boyfriend 27m for about a year now we have been living together for several months and have become codependent i have noticed that he has some angeremotional issues and they have been greatly affecting me there are times where he drives recklessly yells gets angry at the dogs slams things or generally expresses his anger outwardly he is scared me on multiple occasions yet he is simultaneously my only source of emotional support i was in denial about it for a long time and did not tell anyone not even my therapist out of fear that they would make me break up with him or tell me to leave he apologized for his behavior and has committed to going to therapy but i am not sure if it is smart to get back into the relationship as it takes time to healchange each person i have talked to has given contradicting advice although most voted to have a clean breakup many have pointed out the red flags and it is making me second guess a lot of the relationship was it manipulation was i stuck in a submissive role i think it is a mix of a lot of different things or am i still in denial about how toxic it was my logic is that if he could control it he would have stopped meaning he needs time to work on it thus it would be illogical to jump back into a relationship without giving him enough time to work on himself in therapy my therapist recommended taking some time apart although that can translate into many different things distance a break a breakup etc we have spent the past couple of weeks apart on weird talking terms and i just want to figure out what i should do i have never been more confused hurt and alone in my entire life i do not know what to believe anymore i guess i am just trying to figure out if i should still try and make it work all advice is greatly appreciated and i am more than happy to answer any questions since this is a relatively short post thank you for listening sending my love to whoever is reading
1,planning trips stresses me out so much because there are too many variables any advice i have to decide how many vacation days i can take off and predict how many i will need to save for the rest of the year can i get away with flying after a day of work probably not can i get away with arriving home really early and going to work the same day did not work last time i had to take a sick day to recover from the redeye i have to pick a flight possibly starting and ending at different airports there are multiple airports near me to choose from sometimes i also have the option of arriving at one place and leaving from a different place to come home so many cost vs convenience tradeoffs i have to figure out how i am going to get to each airport and whether the cost increase of one thing nullifies the cost savings of the other lyftuber and a little sketchy public transportation cheap but slow inconvenient and several steps to plan and how do i get to train station drive myself and park but convenient ask a friend i do not have many friends i would feel comfortable asking and their schedules probably do not align anyway i have to coordinate with multiple other people at the destination and figure out when their schedules will align with mine which they may not know yet or may recursively depend on my schedule the longer i wait to buy tickets the more sure i am of other peoples plans the longer i wait to buy tickets the more they cost and the fewer options there are there are so many variables and tradeoffs between them and i just get super stressed out and shut down procrastinating until only bad options are left change my perspective or give me tools to help deal with it i can afford to make some of these problems go away by throwing money at them which is nice but i am not rich enough to just choose the most convenient option then the traveling itself stresses me out too yay constantly anxious that i will miss some link in the chain and ruin everything

1,severe stress i literally feel crippled cannot stop throwing up i am a 34 year old female i have had quite a year to say the least amidst all the other nonsense going on covid riots i am also in the middle hopefully near the end of a messy divorce with an extremely resentful ex no kids thankfully due to me moving out on my own i started to have some financial issues then it just seemed to snowball i got into a fender bender in my brand new car have to pay a 500 deductible and unfortunately still pay my car payment i was honestly hoping it would have been totaled and got me out from underneath the loan then i started to get a sinus infection and they made me test for covid which was negative but i had to take a week off work anyway i just cannot seem to get it together and i literally feel like i am killing myself with all this stress and nonsense i feel uncomfortable in my own skin all the time i get very disoriented and dumb feel like i am in a dream debilitating anxiety muscle twitches specifically my right eye shaking exhaustion cannot get my thoughts straight ever i seriously cannot remember if something actually happened lately or if i dreamed it and lately just throwing up constantly going to work is a nightmare i am an insurance broker and have been for 4 years but i have missed a lot of work this year and all of my coworkers pretty much hate me the thought of sitting chained to my desk all day makes me crazy but i know i need to go because i need money it is a nonstop shit show the only thing that seems to help is alcohol which trust me i know does not help i cannot live like this anymore i know there is a happy fun girl in there but i am so lost currently i am on 100mg of zoloft which seems to be doing nothing i was taking mirtazapine briefly which is great for sleep but not so great if you are trying to watch your figure what are some things you guys do to manage your stress i literally feel like i am losing my mind
1,annus horribilus today is the anniversary of my daughters death she died in my arms and i am grateful i could be with her she was 25 and we were very close cut from the same cloth she had long suffered depression and social anxiety which manifested in anorexia and alcoholism creating the perfect storm that resulted in her death she made no secret of her desire to die but her death was not suicide per se in the year prior to her passing i was diagnosed with esophegal cancer and spent a lot of time in hospital getting treatment nobody expected me to live and i think this hit my daughter especially hard as she was very emotionally dependent on me during my time in hospital my ex wife my daughters mother came to stay with my daughter to care for her i have since discovered from reading my daughters reddit emails and texts that her mother was drink and abusive the whole time i demanded to be released from hospital early as my daughters health had deteriorated and they made arrangements to get me home i was unable to speak in more than a whisper had no esophegas and was fed through a tube in my stomach but i was happy to be home with my daughter we spent quality time together when she died a few weeks later i arranged the funeral and the wake i could not deliver a eulogy or even toast her life my daughter had very few friends partly because of her treatment resistant depression and partly because she just did not suffer fools lightly but the friends she did have she treated like gold one was hospitalised after a failed suicide attempt and my daughter drove 400 kms to visit him and she went back every day for days on end just as example none of them could manage to get to her funeral i have recovered mostly now but i do not know why i do not want to live especially after this past year i am posting this not out of self pity but as a belated eulogy to my very very special daughter without her the world is black and white and devoid of happiness
1,feeling ugly basically its exactly what it says i feel ugly when i put on my make up and i get dressed and i go out in the world i feel like i can do anything i feel like i can have anyone i want but when i am in my room in pajamas my hair is not done my face has scars you can see all my flaws when i have not eaten all day and then i finally eat something and i get bloated and i feel fat and gross just tears me open inside i feel like a lot of my selfworth is based on the way that i look and how i am seen to the outside world because the last person i was with kind of taught me that if i did not look a certain way then my worth to him went down the drain and society where looks do matter no matter how you try and put it i have always grown up as a ugly girl i have always had people tell me that i was unattractive that no one could ever want me that i was fat i went through eating disorder after eating disorder i had extremely bad acne growing up and i am finally at an ok weight and finally have my face cleared at least but i always feel like no one could ever love me for the way that i look people tell me i am pretty i get complimented constantly but then i just think if they only knew what i look like with this off and i look at other girls who are with other guys and i just think to myself wow you really are unlovable wow there is something wrong with you you just push everybody away that even manage to get to talk to you and i know that my self talk is probably terrible but it is hard sometimes it is really hard to feel good about myself i feel like i have to hide from the world because nobody would really like me without all of this make up on without me constantly trying to regulate my weight and without me waking up every day and fixing myself i do not post after a certain time and it is weird because i think i am pretty most of the time especially without make up i do not have that selfesteem towards my own self but the way i am perceived by other people is one of my biggest insecurities
1,just putting my thoughts out there i am a phd student and my concentration is deep learning and signal processing i think that gives you an idea about why i am writing this i cannot focus or concentrate on one thought at a time just this morning i was looking at three things simultaneously and could not do any of them properly i am trying to work on image and time series data but if you are familiar you know that these are different kinds of signals and require different kinds of processing every time i try to focus on any of these two i constantly think about the other one i came to machine learning from control systems i am just always worrying about what i do not know in machine learning i do not know enough statistics multivariate calculus basic machine learning theories optimization natural language processing image processing etc etc etc every time i am on my computer i am looking at ten different tabs with online courses the latest papers and some blogs that always lead to other blogs the whole world is now working in machine learning and deep learning i do not know if someone unstable like me can actually make any contribution my professor is not helping that much because honestly i think he is stressed like myself he does not know what he is doing either i am supposed to do some groundbreaking work by competing against google brain and facebook research with zero support and collaboration does not that sound ridiculous and stupid i am feeling like a failure who is worth nothing all the bad things like imposter syndrome and inferiority complex are my constant companion i did nothing else in my life except for study i do not know how to sing or dance or paint my only outlet is cooking which i cannot do nowadays because i am moving across the country in a few days and do not want to waste any food everyone is flying and i am just trying to play catch up i do not know how long i will be able to keep this charade going keep me in your prayers please
1,when you reach that point where what is wrong no longer has an answer when there is no longer any specific thing that you can pinpoint as the reason you are feeling the way you do when you do not even fully understand it yourself why cannot you just be happy if nothing specific happened to ruin your mood when you are so used to feeling depressed that you do not even know how to feel happy during the moments that are supposed to make you happy when the few things you had in life that you used to enjoy either become dull to you or impossible to motivate yourself to do when it starts to seem pointless to even try accomplishing anything because you know that no matter where you are in life you will probably still be depressed when you can no longer stand speaking to the people you love because it is either pretend to be happy or ruin their whole moodday and make them worried about you when even the most simple conversations are very hard to get through without being triggered by something and wanting to break down when it gets to the point where you have heavily considered abruptly cutting the people you love out of your life because interacting with them is becoming exhausting and you would rather them think you are an asshole for isolating from them than to give them the even more painful truth about where your mind is going and what you think is inevitable when the overall feeling of not having anything in your life that makes you happy anymore starts to be far more painful in your mind than actually having negative things happen to you how do you even answer what is wrong when it is both not anything and every single aspect of your life at the same time edit i was not expecting so many people to see and relate to this post but i guess these feelings are more common than any of us thought as much as i hate that other people are going through the same thing reading these replies did make me feel a little more understood and a little less alone so thank you all for that
1,anyone else they live in a family that acutely stresses them out daily with the exception of my father my family are good people but still stress me out we are all adults and i am the youngest of them some examples but not limited to older brother jumps into conversations and often says something that irritates me a snarky comment or tone can be pushy mother is often sarcastic in a bad way if i do not understand something often throws assumptions oh i guess you just do not care about x can also be pushy father the worst stresser and worst person i have ever known impatient very pushy disrespectful violent towards family and animals easily irritated unpredictable honestly his presence just puts a lot of weight on my shoulders because i feel like i have to take his shit otherwise he will take his anger on someone else if i walk away which will just make things much worse such as a fight so i often have to have a different persona around him i think the only exception is my sister it seems she is more simple and calm when compared to the rest of the 3 even at times where i am suppose to relax i cannot 100 just temporarily forget my worries it is hard to find a place to be alone both at home and outside even under a tree i am afraid something will happen at home and i will not be there to stop it or i will receive a terrible phone call mostly because of my father escelating situations add those things along with worrying about health problems such as my hearing and tinnitus i look forward to the day where i am in complete control of my life if i ever have a family it will only happen if i know for sure that i know me and my wife will be good to each other and others otherwise i look forward to the day where i am free of my current uncontrollable stresses where i can wake up one morning feed the animals and relax outside a time in my life where i can control on solving my stressors oh well it could be a lot worse but it could be better in the future
1,my philosophy on suicide a little while ago i vented about how unhelpful it was to tell suicidal people about how other people would feel if they committed suicide the main reason being that a person who is in the suicidal mindset will feel worse off because it makes them feel guilty about being suicidal and instead people should put their focus when talking to a suicidal person on that persons emotions i did not express that very clearly in the last post because i was pretty angry and wanted to get it out though some concerned about if i was going to kill myself while i appreciate the concern and i have had suicidal tendencies for a while now i am not going to kill myself not for a long time at least that is because i like to create music and stories and shit and at the risk of coming off as pompous i am an artist at my core i have so many projects i want to finish and share and i think every time someone creates a piece of art metaphorically speaking they put a little piece of their soul into making it soul as in their energy their experiences their emotions etc i am very lucky to sometimes have the energy to create art and i have projects i want to finish and if i am dead i will never be able to finish those projects the longer i live the more experiences i will have including experience with anxiety and depression the more my soul will grow the more art i can create the day i finish all of my projects and i have nothing else to give to the world nothing i can create i have created all i have could that is the day i kill myself because i have finished what i live to but if i keep on willingly living i will never run out of stories to tell i will never run out of art to make that is why i am not going to kill myself so do not worry about me but i hope some of you all can take what i say to heart maybe there is something you can keep on living for if you do not know or do not think there is something like that in you you just have not realized what it is yet
1,did you ever end a relationship in peek depression and did regret it later on my former bf broke up with me a few days ago he was struggling for 2 months now and in the beginning he was still staying with me reaching out he kept saying he wants to be with me we had arguments tough fights but we stayed together both doing our best i granted him space he tried to still reach out two weeks ago all went worse something happened and he said he just wants to be alone he does not want to care for anybody and he is deeply sorry but that is how it is he even refuses to talk to his family shuts them out an me says his safe place are his gaming friends i am not the person he can talk to anymore it was very important to him to let me know none of this is my fault and i did not do anything wrong it is all on him he just is not at the place to be there for me or help me he needs someone to talk to things have happened and things have changed the guy i knew is gone and will not come back he had to go so he can get better and stronger i still do not know what that means he rather wants me to move on and find someone who can give me the world than being friends with me he cannot talk to me anyway he blocked me on snapchat where he usually sends snaps to friends and where we had some serious conversations the last days after break up he reached out not me but kept me on all other messengers and platforms he said he thinks we will not work out he says he does not know what will happen he is also suicidal and has adhd he said he does not want anybody or anyone he only wants to be alone and all his feelings are gone whenever i ask him how he feels about me he does not know he never said anything about not loving me anymore i am deeply hurt and heartbroken i thought we could handle it i did research for months and was there for him did not leave when it got tough but sometimes love is not enough did he break up with me or did depression i need closure
1,my brother plans to kill himself on 72 hi everyone i am 24 yo female my brother is a 19 yo mid may my brother was taken to the hospital for attempting suicide his online friends called his college to request a wellness check and got the cops involved they found him unconscious in his dorm room we have a very toxic mom to give you some context my mom told him do it right the next time so we do not have to drive 8 hours to pick you up she loves us but she is very immature toxic physically abusive mentally abusive etc she is sort of a horrible human being but in her mind she has done all she can for us she had me when she was 19 single mom we do not talk to our dad he is set on doing it again because my brother and i have an extremely close relationship and he does not want to be a burden on me he has been failing school hates my mom and feels like if he kills himself my life will become better because my mom will realize she is the problem but my mom will never know that he thinks i will be sad for a couple of years but i will get through it because i am a strong person he has told my boyfriend that he has bought 100 pills this time for his second attempt my brother is the best but my mom has fucked him up so much he feels like he does not deserve my love and feels extremely guilty that i will have to take care of him when i went through so much to get where i am i just graduated with a masters degree and looking for a job on the west coast i also want to note there is a genetic component on my moms side my grandpa my uncle have killed themselves my mom has attempted suicide when i was in high school by jumping off our apartment but survived i have been depressed since age 7 but became healthy two years ago my brother has felt this way since he was 10 i told him once i get a job i can take him away forever and help him get his life back on track but he does not want to burden me what do i do has anyone been in a situation like this
1,i feel like i have nowhere to turn what do you do when you have complained to your friends and family so much about stress over the years that no one even takes you seriously anymore i am in a bad place where i e got a lot of seriously important life events to get on with and no energy left to do them everyone i am close to is breathing down my neck about getting stuff done when i can barely get out of bed if i try to explain what is wrong i am greeted with rolled eyes or being told to grow up suicide has never been an option for me but now with the addition of some serious medical problems that i have not even sorted out yet i am in so much mental and physical pain 247 that i do not feel like i have got the energy to try anymore i really just want help but it is impossible to get professional help right now and everyone i love is sick of hearing about my problems or does not have the slightest idea of how to help me i deleted this post a few times not sure if i should bother but i am at the end of my rope here i cannot seem to convey how in trouble i am to anyone close to me so i feel like there is no way to improve my situation on top of that i am supposed to be moving 800 miles away by december 1st when i have not even started packing yet and i am totally broke i am essentially completely screwed right now and i have not the slightest idea of how to fix this like i said i can barely get out of bed i really do not want to die yet there is stuff i would like to accomplish first but i have no idea where to go from here it seems like there is no support whatsoever or people think i am too stubborn to get anywhere with me even doing drugs has no effect i spent a good decade doing drugs to help manage my stress but they have no effect anymore this is just my version of flailing around screaming i need help hoping someone can just throw me a raft or i am just going to drown i am out of money out of time and out of options so what the hell does someone even do in this situation
1,slow suicide honestly i do not see how therapy could even help me at this point i am currently starving myself because i hate my appearance especially my chubby face i assume i am suffering from bddbut it does not matter because i do not want to get treatment anyway i do not agree with the notion that i deserve a happy lifenot only that but i would have to once againlike with most things in my life redefine my definition of happiness which i refuse to just because there is people like me who have managed to live a meaningful life does not mean i should or couldif i were them i would not want to live either looking and living with my faceas well as imagining my life and future with itmakes me feel like deathlike when someone you love diesthat grief when you cry all the time because you cannot cope with the futility of the situationthere is nothing you can do and this is your life now and forever crying and feeling the worst pain everbeing able to calm down for a whiledistracting yourself participating in lifewhatever life looks like for youonly to remember and start crying again imagine the first few days or weeks after someone is deathbut feeling like that every day for months and years seeing myself makes me sick i gag and lose my appetite will to do anything if i saw myselfi would shoot myself in the face being at this stage where i am cold all the time in pain from not eating having heart palpitationsfeeling like i am dyingmakes me feel happy people try to warn me share their concernsas if they are not feeding into my disorder as if death scares me honestly i love seeing myself rot slowly rotting away feeling the flesh disappearingknowing some day i will not have to be conscious in this body anymore and all that is going to be left of me is going to be bones i do not see how the argument that death is a permanent solution to a temporary problem is supposed to help define temporary one whole life is temporary
1,i hate it so much when you try and express your feelings to your parents but they turn it around and compare your suffering with theirs i have been feeling really depressed and lonely lately from my job i am a full time late night janitor for a courthouse just 10 miles away from my hometown working there has been pretty easy but i wound up feeling super lonely a lot considering i do not really get to talk to my friends or hang out with them much so just today i came home late as usual and i have a little interaction with my mom after she made a joke to me that i took pretty personal and felts like was more of an insult rather than a sense of humor i told her that i did not really want to joke around like that but she refused to listen and told me to just go away then despite attempting to change the topic and explain why i have not been feeling so high all she kept doing was telling what a great mom she is for raising me and my brother while struggling to make ends meet and keep the house what an ungrateful little bastard i am for not appreciating her hard work and sacrifices at that moment i was legitimately about to begin to cry but rather instead of pausing and trying to reverse the damages all my mom did was host a little parental style of the oppression olympics and proclaim her amount of tears and cries over the course of three weeks i got out just before my first tear would legitimately run down my cheek and even before i went to bed she goes on about how her life is more worse than ours then escalates into a more this is why you would make a terrible mistake getting behind the wheel considering i had practice driving this morning unaware that she had just lite the fuse to trigger the firework but she did not seem to care thanks for reading i hope you feel better soon and find the key to unlocking your next set of happiness along with having a parent who does not make your suffering all about them and why you should not be depressed
1,am just being unreasonable i am a guy in the mid 30s had only a single relationship and intimacy partner so far and i am almost literally dying to be close to a girl but through that relationship i learned a lot about myself which did not improved my already broken self image one thing is that i cannot have a serious relationship with a girl i barely feel attracted to might sound like a nobrainer but i mean by character and looks character alone will just end badly because of the second problem there always will be a more attractive girl again maybe a nobrainer even if alone for statistical reasons but it is still a problem withfor me no matter how attractive my girl would be eventually there would be a more attractive one stealing at least part of my attention intentionally or not but what i mean with this so far is just how i would end up feeling as far as attractiveness by looks go just because there is another girl which looks more attractive than mine does not mean i would dare to drop or intentionally neglect her but i am also not that dense to think that everythings going to be fine if i end up fantasizing about another girl that just hurts no matter if it is by being found out or just open about it having your so correctly guess it or incorrectly assume it it is painful at least if not outright insulting regardless of being in control about those feelings or not so when i end up day dreaming again about having a cute girlfriend the spiral to hell goes down fast starting with my selfhate for being a hypocrite by wishing for a cute girlfriend while i am at best just average looking then it steps up to how i deserve not even an equally average looking one for the reasons above and eventually i end up at the burnt in perception that i am just a waste of space and resources which should never have come to existence so i am wondering is my self image just broken or am i really just a fuck boy with depressions
1,i want to commit suicide soon i have no one to talk to about this let me vent here i have leftover medicines i can overdose on i just do not know if i need to buy some alcohol so it is more fatal i had this strong urge to drink them all last night but stopped because my partner in a project tomorrow messaged me if i were to go last night i would bring trouble to her as i have to bring some items i will probably do it after that project is done tomorrow and if i still feel the same last night another friend told me about when they tried overdosing and waking up feeling asphyxiated i played this game where we sent messages anonymously about our feelings and reread an old message where a stranger said they tried overdosing but lived on to regret it but now i am still feeling empty and want to end it all this decision is powered by how i feel like people who i thought were close to me did not care instead they did not reach me out they stopped replying to my chat even knowing i felt suicidal because it is already night and they want to sleep maybe i am selfish for wanting them to stay and comfort me it is the weekend and there is no work to do maybe they think i will not do it as it is not my first time expressing my suicidal tendencies been up and down for 2 years but never really tried because i want to really pass away on my first try i believe even if i were to go they will not care or they might feel sad for a while and then it will all be better things are bad for me every single aspect of my life i feel no happiness being alive two years ago i said i would try and see if things would change here i am now nothing really changes should have ended my life years ago i do not live in the usa so my only concern is how do i give my belongings and bank account without a formal will i already composed a will 2 years ago saved in my laptop i will update it before i go and hope someone can find it and exact my will for me life is just not for me

1,money and mother so today i am stressing and having a painful headache today my whole family says i am codo mexican street word of saying cheap that it hurts for me to spend money on my mother which is half true it hurts but i at least give her something like right now i have been doing better on give her some money so she can buy herself something or when i bought her pans because she needed pans but this week i failed for her birthday because i did not willingly offered to buy the cake or pay a whole lasagna because my dad kept asking how much he owes me so i said we can split the check however that was wrong because it was a test if i was willingly going to offer in paying the whole meal that my mom wanted they say i am cheap but i always buy stuff that my family likes even though yeah hurts me but if they want it i will buy it right now i guess this is me just to vent i do not know what to do to prove to my parents that i am not cheap and that i have been buying stuff willingly for my mother my father says i still have mothers day and christmas to do it correctly i guess but for today my moms birthday i got her a necklace that said mom and a birthday card it stresses me out because they say that i have not changed but i feel like i have doing very small baby steps in changing this bad characteristic of me but they expect me to drastically change because i guess it is a habit that they never taught me to break at a young age i do not think i am a penny pincher but i know it hurts when my bank account goes down but i mean i know my mom would do the same for me in buying stuff that i would like i am horrible with presents and sometimes i wish my mom could give me strong hints in what she wants and give me an idea what to give her but can someone help out on how to change this habit and prove my parents i am not a cheapskate on my mom for special occasions or when she is wanting them and how can i be more aware on what she wants
1,you ever get asked the where do you see yourself in five years question in a job interview or something and have to stutter because probably not alive is the kneejerk response first off what a stupid fucking question to ask anyway what do you want to hear as the interviewer when you ask that question that i am indifferent and stagnant enough to stay with your company that long assuming you hire me or that i am ambitiously arrogant enough to in five years plan on being well passed this shit fuckin hell man undoubtedly there are varying degrees of suicidality just as there are reasons for doing it all depends on the person i suppose i am the sloth suicidal i have tiptoed through and around depression for the better part of my conscious life and i cannot help but feel miserable an overwhelming percentage of the time yet when the obvious solution to this conundrum of despising being alive is well do not be alive anymore the meddling safeguards of thinking about the wake of my actions swelling over everything and everyone i leave behind effectively whiteout any sort of blueprint i have for seeing myself out of my life sounds rather counterintuitive but i would rather my last thoughts be more you gave it a go you are not doing anything wrong you do you kiddo and less hey you are a tremendous asshole for this i hope you know that i can comfortably say i am not doing it tonight or tomorrow or this year or even the next but i genuinely feel like that is how i am going out pending the absence of a freak car crash or lightning strike or some shit do not even really know what i am trying to say here but do you ever feel like this like life is essentially an existential clusterfuck that you want no part of but for whatever fucking reason just cannot make any sort of move afterthought cannot help but laugh that when driveling on in this post i look up at the browser tab and it says submit to depression haha fuckin a
1,i cannot stand my family and their dysfunction i have been suffering from the flulike symptoms for half a decade now from throat tightening nasal drips muscle soreness cold and general depression and now that i am stuck inside the house with my family i cannot help but feel helpless my dad blows a fuse for the smallest things completely negative judgmental over everyone that is why we do not have family or visitors come over the house no one likes him for his personality ges just far better off that is why people kiss his ass what i hate the most is that they do not have a sense of boundaries not being able to have control and say about my personal items when he gets unreasonable really upsets me for example he fucking threw my plants away because he saw news about an increase of dengue cases cannot i have anything that is mine he is needy and requires special treatment from everyone it is such a drain to be around his negativity and his overall personality he takes food from my plate even there is literally whole untouched piece right in front of him he took my food that i paid for without permission even though we are not in speaking terms it is not that i am tight wad and selfish but the fact that he gets to take my stuff and do as he pleases is the problem what is worse is that this learned behavior is exactly what my asshole of a brother does as well i get anxious just being near or around him yesterday i hit my head bad and it started to bleed as i hurried and went into a frantic pace trying to leave the kitchen as soon as he opened his mouth and started talking to me about how to live my fucking life we are not even in speaking terms my mom even left the country to get away from this asshole they are not divorced or anything but she is making a sacrifice for us to get japanese citizenship started investing there no wonder my mom had the foresight to offer me to leave the country and this horrible family
1,how do i deal with school with depression so i am going into the 10th grade this year which for some of you is year 11 but i am very worried about how i will be able to keep on top of school last school year i barely did anything at all i could not the beginning of my academic downfall was when i was taken into a residential programme to deal with a series of mental problems during and when i got out i felt too morbidly depressed to do pretty much anything especially school work i would never shower never brush me teeth never flush the toilet never clean my bedroom you know the routine my school is very demanding but i was lucky that the faculty was aware that i was not able to be as ahead as my peers which helped because it felt as if everything was far too overwhelming to do and i physically could not without my head hurting or something of the sort now that summer is over and school is starting again i have no idea how i am going to manage keeping on top of my work i do really want to try my best this year but i can barely complete or start my first few assignments without getting insanely overwhelmed this year i will not get the same leniency as i did last year and honestly i cannot say i want it either because it too came with its downsides other kids would get angry at me because i was exempt from doing some assignments and also it made me feel as if i would failed at being a human along with everything else i could barely keep on top of my hygiene i would not eat i could barely get out of bed or look the slightest bit decent when leaving the house it was as if i was a baby that had to be carried around due to it is helplessness i hated it albeit it was far better than drowning in my own academic failure and being personally held accountable for my lack of effort towards my education in conclusion i am wondering how i can keep on top of school work without getting very overwhelmed due to my depression
1,i hate that i feel like i cannot talk or share anything on the internet anymore i was part of a like i am not good at talking but like there is some rare niche program that let us you make computer games any time i asked for help in the forums people always responded with yeah i could very easily help you out with your coding problems i see what you did wrong and i could give you advice but instead i am just going to laugh at you for being such a bad programmer and then they invited me to a discord and they were all about memes and everytime i chatted there people would post weird pepe meme faces etc and make fun of me then someone invited me to a smaller discord saying its not like that there but it is and whenever i posted on reddit and other places often times people would say is this a troll thread so then i try to say and no this is not a troll thread but then people respond saying this must be a troll thread if you say no this is not a troll thread its so freaking noisy here and i feel very stressed out and anxious about stuff but i am too afraid to post about it anywhere i thought it was safe to post in a community for autistic people since i too have autism but a moderator banned me saying the ban reason is that i am a clear bad example of someone with autism i just do not feel comfortable venting anywhere and haters found my private vent videos and reuploaded them on to youtube without my permission at all and my online friend who says he would have blocked me by now but he is too nice and he always says depressing negative things to me every day multiple times said people were linking to those videos and making fun of me saying i am not mature for venting in those private venting videos that the haters reuploaded from my private vent account onto a public youtube channel without my permission to make fun of me i just do not feel comfortable at all and i feel so bad
1,subconscious anxiety manifesting physically need help recently i found myself having a sensation of tightness in my chest and throat globus sensation it is been around for about 2 weeks now no it is not covid and it is super uncomfortable the only relief i get is sleep i do not have as many anxious thoughts like i used to but i am under a lot of stress with work there is nothing i actively dislike about my job it is just that there is a lot to do at the moment and it probably will not let up for another few weeks i would happily work through it except i cannot go one minute without feeling like i need to inhale very deeply because of this horrible sensation in my throat and chest i was on 10 mg of citalopram until recently which helped me out of a really bad patch and i have upped to 20 mg on the advice of my gp waiting for it to kick in i have also been taking 100 mg of ltheanine twice a day in the morning and at night i take 600mg of ksm66 ashwaganda at night too i also have tried diazepam on occasion im wary of its addictive properties so i do not take it regularly and am not comfortable with taking more than 4mg in a day but this sensation is not going away beta blockers make me incredibly tired i will happily try it on a weekend but for work days it is not going to be great does anyone know any way that i can get some relief from this i do not exactly know what i am anxious about so i cannot actually change my thought patterns the work stress is probably one of the causes but there is nothing i can do about it at this moment and i just wish that it did not manifest itself in this horrible physical way backstory i definitely have issues with anxiety and have done for pretty much my whole life had a really bad period between april and june but through counselling and changing my medication my thought patterns have definitely got on better i also changed jobs which has been a massive help
1,do you guys ever have intrusive thoughts about what a horrible person you are over past mistakes that nobody even remembers or cares about since this pandemic began i have been experiencing a lot of guilt and remorse over very trivial cringy stuff i did when i was a kid even though i realize how ridiculous this is my mind still convinces me i am a terrible person worthless and undeserving of happiness and that i do not deserve to take care of myself this has begun to affect my concentration and i have been losing sleep i was just wondering if anybody else is experiencing this is this a symptom of depression is it my low selfworth i do not know why i feel this way does anyone have advice thank you in advance i would be appreciative of any advice i can get edit guys ty ty thank you for the support red_heart i just want to quickly say that reading the comments made me feel less alone in my struggle it breaks my heart knowing others are going through the same thing i took you guys advice and spoke to someone i can trust about my stupid past actions and well they thought i was worrying over nothing this really made me feel relieved as i thought they would be ashamed of me or something it is crazy what your mind can convince you of that being said starting tomorrow i will be working on my sleep schedule and treating myself better if that fails i will seek therapy good night guys i cannot thank you enough and i wish you all the best i appreciate you all so much you lovely human beings edit i am so glad to hear that some of you are also reading the comments on here and feel a sense of relief that this is more common than you thought honestly i had no idea either there is some great advice on here guys and i will make sure to read back on it if i ever start to doubt myself again i have also saved some of your posts on my phone just as a reminder that i should not be so hard on myself
1,i really hate when people invalidate a depression diagnosis as someone being lazy and etc depression does not exist you just want to be special and quirky you stay in bed all day because you are lazy most people diagnosed with depression do not even meet the diagnostic criteria why cannot you just be happy depression is just an excuse i think i have heard it all at this point really if depression does not exist is that why i lay in bed all day starving myself if depression does not exist is that why i leave the duty that is showering at weeks at a time i did not realize being smelly was special and quirky if depression does not exist is that why i will not leave my house do you honestly think laziness is the reason i was reported as a missing person to the police if depression does not exist why do i cry when i glance at myself in the mirror why am i isolating myself from family and friends why did i cut into my wrists why did i abuse substances if depression did not exist an open letter to all those people out there saying just be happy that is cute you have probably had a comfortable life with parents who loved you unlike me whose relationship with my parents has always been toxic my dad first invalidated my diagnosis at 16 by saying depression did not exist he also threatened to kick me out onto the streets and then again 2 years after that when my anorexia got worse he just keeps me around because i have some leftover money from school and he wants it i have come close to suicide a few times once when i was 16 and another time when i was 20 recently it is been on mind as i am hitting new lows but i do not think i could ever do it because i am just so in love with my boyfriend though if he ever betrayed me who knows what i would do i do not know myself it feels like i have no one except him and i know what men are like after being cheated on before in past relationships
1,i am so tired i thought when school reopened and normal learning would commence i would be ok that i would be away from my family and i would not feel so horrible all the time that was a fucking lie because apparently school is overwhelming as fuck too i cannot hold a conversation without overthinking i embarrass myself and act weird and this sounds stupid as fuck but i am terrified of the boys in my class they are not dangerous or any of that they are just so loud i wonder how they can retain so much life inside of them i cannot do it the cycle the heaviness both physical and mental my demanding studies i guess my next plan is to get into a good university and keep up my academics so i can get a job and move out there is this kind of prize ceremony at my school where you can win scholarships but i do not know if i should try because i would not know what to do with myself if i failed to secure a good future for myself i mean i am still freshman so i should not put to much emphasis into my future as of yet i still have time but i feel like i have been thrown in for a loop because i do not even think i will make it past graduation age alive i have to get up my bag is so heavy with the textbooks my body hurts from all the cuts and bandages are such a nuisance my parents are so overwhelming and scary i am not even that smart of a person i made the choice of joining this un council type thing as an after school program i thought it would look good on college applications but i am a very shy and withdrawn person and i have realized i am probably going to get my ass kicked in any debate the other students in the council are so much more clear with their words more accomplished and brilliant than i am i do not stand next to them at all i thought this last year sucked ass i do not know what i am going to do about this one thanks for listening to my rant if you have read this far i bid you a good day
1,my neighbour is stressing me out she has two kids and her friends always come over with small children and babys we love in an apartment she is the door right across from me when we first moved in two years ago we introduced ourselves to her and her partner at the time we were very friendly she is in her late 30s me and my boyfriend are in our mid 20s i have never seen her partner after that though out the years we have tried knocking on her door asking her to move her car for snow removal and to maybe split with us to get the whole driveway plowed but she never answers her door even if we know she is in there so we noticed that our garbage bin was full of loose garbage for a while not ours we cleaned it out put it in bags and took it to the curbthe next week it was full again dog poop baby dipers the neighbour just got a dog last summer we empty it again wanting to use our garbage binthe next week it is full again so we leave it it is been full for 3 months now and no one has touched it so a week later we go to put our compost into our compost bin and it is full of garbage the same kind of loose stuff in the bin we have no idea what to do with our compost now last week we took it and put it in our downstairs neighbors compost bin at the curb now i do not know if it is actually her garbage bug i have always seen her garbage in the ally and never at the curb including when she had bags to me i know it is her but i do not know what to do about it if i try to get ahold of her she ignores the door and if i leave a note on her door she will probably just chuck it and be made at us because she is untitled she smokes in her apartment and blasts music and always seems to be partying i have no idea what i should do me on the other handi have not been able to leave my house with out an axiety meltdown and i do not know how to put a lock on my greenbin
1,looking for someone relatable to chat to hey i am a 28yo guy who finds himself in a bit of a pickle i used to be a very happygolucky type of guy but i always had some anxiety i struggled with when i turned 18 alcohol helped a lot in reducing the anxiety but in turn i used to get very drunk to try to not feel anxious i did not really mind at the time it seemed like a good trade i figured my anxiety would get reduced by getting older and getting more selfesteem i got older but my selfesteem and anxiety only got worse i started prioritizing online friendships over real ones as i felt less crippled by anxiety and could be more true to myself and not keep up the facade that i had built irl i had a lot of fun online with some great people but eventually we stopped playing together as much and talking less and just split up during this time i got more and more depressed without even realizing it at first eventually i did not talk to anyone irl and the few ones i had online i felt i could not talk or play with i felt nothing was fun anymore and very slowly i started realizing that i was becoming depressed a year of depression go brrr and i am here i feel i have learned a lot about myself this last year how why and when i have never had meaning to my life but i have never needed it because i kept myself busy doing things i enjoyed now in my current state i do still struggle to find enjoyment in things but i know at least one thing i want and that is to make contact with people find someone i click with i feel like i am getting better but loneliness is a big hurdle and while i get more of my irl sorted i would love to have someone to talk to i am big into internet culture and music some anime stuff i love party games pls invite me to jackbox etc i hope i am not breaking any rules with this post please reach out if you find any of this relatable and maybe we can chitchat
1,tomorrow my depression will be one year old i do not know if i need to celebrate or to complain my self i am 18 years old i am from mexico and until a few months ago i realized that i could have something upset at the beginning of august 2019 my life took a pretty good turn everything was going to improve and it did my school demanded so much time that i did not have time for anything i was extremely happy everything was going well grades friends i was even going to start a relationship with a very special girl my family had finally found a balance when the pandemic arrived i was not so affected but it all started when my cousin decided to commit suicide on august 31 2020 without any sign or warning it was all very sudden they asked me to give a few words at his funeral but i could not and all those things that i still had to say i kept to myself all this year i had good times and bad but little by little everything rotted my family separated completely my school closed and that dream of having graduated from that school disappeared after all i filled many of my afternoons smoking marijuana and tried to fill in those little holes that i was living in march it was the last time i saw my mother because of a stupid thing i did and that every day makes me feel guilty i filled my days with depressing philosophy i walked away from all my friends my life really stopped sometimes i start to think and i imagine myself with a psychologist talking about my problems and only realizing that my life is wrong but what could it be wrong i do not have any disability or something some disease that prevents me from being happy but problems overwhelm me and take my breath away i am speechless in these situations sometimes i start to think what would have happened to me if the whole pandemic had not happened i just wanted to share my story thanks for reading
1,i have lost my best friend i have pretty much been alone this past month and a half my best friend and boyfriend of 2 and a half years told me that we would be taking a short break for his mental health i know how hard life can be and that his situation also sucked so i after many a tear went a long with it even though i felt it was a little over board i love this man with all my heart and soul and i hoped that he would be okay as i know his depression episodes get bad when not delt with quick and i was always there to help when available after a few weeks i tried texting a few friends one thing you must know about me is i am not very popular and do not have many friends and just started at a new school one friend helped me out the best they could but recently have just trailed off and left me here during this time not only was my family involved in so much crap on both sides but many a family member are sick my car legitimately broke down my phone broke itself and i have no one who really is there for me i am all alone now it feels so difficult to do anything even get up now that i have lost my best friend in the whole world after going through so many other trammatic relationships i was abused in 2 other relationships i feel like a waste of a person i feel like him saying he is coming back is a lie that he told me to maybe give me a false since of hope and happiness but then again i do not know i really want to believe what he is saying is true but it is almost been 2 months now i really just feel like my feelings have been disregarded and that i am always the one who cares the most about everyone now that they are all gone i do not feel okay i feel so lonely i just want my best friend backi know reddit is a strange place to go with this but i have no good options left and the people here seem like they are pretty chill anyways that is my story

1,physical symptoms hi just wanted to ask if stress can cause many many weird physical symptoms all started when my taste and smell senses decreased a lot for a few weeks took 3 covid tests and all negative during the same time my right arm started to hurt then my right leg and some time later my whole right side of body went numb not like paralized numb but skin feels numb and tight i also have buzzing in my arm and leg and my fingers feel stiff a few days ago my little toe in right leg went numb too like really cannot move it and my jaw hurts a lot on the right side that jaw thing has been going of for the last year dentists say nothing is wrong i noticed that i clenched my teeth sometimes so thought that maybe i am just so stressed and this is the outcome but right now i do not clench my teeth but my jaw pain is still back with all these new symptoms anyway i have been to my doctor and neurologist and right now i am waiting for mris neuro wants to eliminate ms when this all first started i did not feel more stressed or anything but now of course i am stressed i feel kind of fine some days and then the other days like today my arm and leg are in so much pain i think nerve pain my skin feels very sensitive and almost painful to touch too and i just feel so weak and tired and only want to stay in bed and feel like i want to cry so i guess my question is that could all these symptoms be because of stress or anxiety my neuro seems nice but all the other doctors seemed to think and said that maybe you are just stressed of course i do not want to get diagnose like ms from my neuro but at the same time i really would not want to believe that just stress could cause these kind of symptoms have anyone had similar physical symptoms and turned out it was just stress or anxiety could stress really make me be physically in pain or numb like this

1,i may not be unlovable but i am pretty sure i am incapable of feeling loved my parents were pretty emotionally distant and demanding growing up my dad was a military man and a preacher he had very specific ideas about the right way to do basically everything and preached to us ad nauseam the importance of righteousness my mom was in hindsight i would say she was probably dealing with some trauma herself she is not a nurturing person despite being the stay at home mother who raised me and my brothers and sisters when my wife and i started dating she had to initiate physical contact hugging was never something my family ever did growing up when i went to college and people were hugging each other i was honestly confused it is become this joke in our marriage about how she had to teach me how to hug rationally i know there are people in my life who love me my parents would say they love me though they have always been abysmal at expressing that in any meaningful way i am sure my wife loves me though it seems like half the time we are just tolerating each other or too busy coping with the firehose of bullshit that is adult life i have three kids i am sure they love me though it really feels like most of the time i am with them they are literally screaming at me i guess i have friends who would probably say they love me but i do not really see any friends ever my siblings would say they love me i do not see them very often while writing this my son came up and asked if we could cuddle i should feel warmth at this i put my kids to bed tonight they all hugged and kissed me and told me they loved me but i just do not feel it i feel tired and empty my brain does not feel or think positive nice things about itself i really really do not have those neural pathways i also do not know what to do about that i do not like myself or enjoy my life
1,is there a light at the end of the tunnel i have been battling with chronic stress for about 3 weeks now i want to say the because of it is my job it is the only thing that makes sense due to the pandemic i have had 4 different positions within the past 3 months my regular position that i held before this all this happened was awesome i actually loved my job and looked forward to work each morning when everything shut down back in march until about the middle of may i was moved to two other positions that we still pretty relaxed the hours just kind of sucked but now this new role that i have been in for about a month is killing me it is very stressful the days are long it seems like a constant race against the clock the people i deal with can be a pain which adds more stress i keep telling myself it is only temporary and hopefully i will be able to get my old job as things start to normalize more but for the past 3 weeks my symptoms have included weighted chest most prominent symptom lightheadednessdizziness tightness in neck and shoulders lower back pain anxiety that will not go away rapid heartbeat acid refluxheartburn stomach issues fatigue i have tired to change my diet to start eating a bit healthier i have also been trying breathing exercises and doing stretching in the evenings when i get home from work it seems to help a little i also plan on getting back to the gym because i know exercise will help out as well i am just wondering if this is something that will eventually go away or am i in it for the long haul i have felt this way once before about a month before my daughter was born but it completely went away right after she was born not kidding maybe big life changes are my trigger but i did not feel this way when i got married or bought a house or anything like that any insight or advice to manage this is greatly appreciated
1,stress postcar accident background my actual car is a manual and it got reversed into the other day so driving an automatic hire car last night i was driving with my girlfriend back to her house and i felt a bit sick in the stomach and was just sitting in silence i was in my own world stressing about my car and life in general i was driving at about 8090kmh and for the first time ever i mistakenly thought i was still in my own car and as something went into my eye i went to downshift so i could keep a bit of control and speed whilst i fix my eye and i hit the break with my left foot in the 1 second it took to process everything and think about everything that was going on and as i was going to take my foot off the break the car that was behind me smashed into us and caused a 4 car accident yes it was a very honest mistake it was the first time it is ever happened and i thank god no one was seriously hurt the car behind me seemed too close but i just cannot help being depressed about the whole situation if i would have stopped at a service station earlier or been in a different lane would it still have happened am i the one at fault because i made that small mistake why did it have to happen when my girlfriend was in the car with me just why i feel like everyone has the right to push me down and say i am in the wrong and i feel everyone should criticise me and make me feel like the piece of trash i am people keep saying accidents happen and sometimes god puts us through things we do not understand and that they have done the same thing too when driving an automatic but i cannot help but feel like they are just taking pity on me and do not want me to feel bad when i should tldr was the front car in an accident and i do not think i am at fault but cannot help but feel like i am just need some help on how to stop stressing and feeling like this
1,my problem i have no faith in myself i have been the same since high school i work really really hard for everything because i am convinced that i will not be able to achieve anything if i put a normal amount of effort in throughout high school and college school stressed me out like crazy i would spend 10s of hours studying for tests instead of just 23 like my friends it would always take me a really long time because a lot of times while studying i would get stressed and not be able to think clearly my friends would praise me for being able to spend so much time studying and being focused in reality i was going crazy on the inside my methods worked got into an awesome university after high school and also have an amazing job right now but despite all that i still struggle with believing in myself i am convinced i am stupid and will not be able to solve problems on my own this past month i really struggled to finish a project it caused me so much stress i lost my appetite and lost lots of weight because i was always feeling stressedbadsad that i was not able to finish the project at the pace i wanted and i was not able to solve bugs quickly i know a lot of times the answer is right in front of me when working on code but just like when i was studying my mind gets clouded with stress and i cannot think or do anything properly i dread going to work and i am not able to properly enjoy life outside of work either my bf visited me this past week and i could not be happy he was there even though i had not seen him in two months because of the stress i had in my head how do i get myself to not be so emotionally tied to work i cannot keep being like this i know it will hinder me from being successful i am currently trying to exercise in the mornings and meditate for 510 minutes anyone else have this problem how did you deal with it
1,i am so stressed out that i am tired even after sleeping until 7pm i liked going to this forum for depressed people the only problem was one of the mods there who happens to be the husband of the owner of the forum has always been really rude to me and every time i reported his mean comments he would get super ticked off at me i posted a letters to admin thread saying i still feel bad that back in august that guy pmd me telling me to stop complaining about him and asking me why cannot you just be normal and that guy or his wife who is nice but biased towards her husband it seems ip banned me i was chatting with members there one of them was a nice member that helped explain a very bad situation i am in quite clearly but when i was ip banned and used a form to ask if i was really banned i got a message back and it said some rude things such as everyone is tired of you messaging them now i feel really bad i did not know i was bothering people that much there to make matters all the worst i was freaking locked out of my twitter account i followed like just 3 accounts in a row seriously and was locked out for unusual activity usually when this happens i get texted a verification code and enter that and it let us me back in however this time it said i will get a phone call with a verification code i tried 3 times but i do not get a phone call i emailed twitter explaining that and requesting to get a text verification code again instead of a phone call but i just got this terrible automated response now that i cannot get into my twitter account and it does not allow me to make a new account because too many accounts are linked to my phone number i do not know how to do the only thing i really feel like doing sharing my gaming videos and drawings etc it really really stresses me out now i am just really tired
1,17 yo do not have a fucking clue about life hey i have been so stressful with the things going on in my life finishing highschool college exam pandemic process etc actually it is mostly about my exam because in my country it is hard to find a valuable job without college our economy is going worse day by day so i think i must do it and in turkey it is also so stressful in these times for people because all the thing is depended on a single exam we do end of the year literally a single one day test we take whether thinking about it or life i find myself always being sad because of a certain thing and i cannot remember all of them in one though i feel like i am not growing or i did not grew at all i am shorter than my coevals my penis size is embarrassingly small and in this young age i have a visually perceivable hair loss i do not know tonight i am sad with my hairs and that is why i decided to write and i do not know what you people can help with but i just feel sad and shitty maybe hair can be cured but i do not know anything about it though they started falling when i grew them longer than usually i use and when i cutted them again they just did not stop to now when i look into mirror and see baldy parts i hate my life and i know this stress just makes everything worse but i want to have a normal penis a not falling hair at least at my fucking 17th year and a nice college life but it seems i am far far away from all of these also i am fat and i want to exercise and shit but first i need to get start from somewhere with studying and then i think i can make all of these with an order in the end it still seems like i cannot do anything with the other 2 things i do not know if it is the right place to write this down but i think i am depressed since my 7th grade because just how life basically works thank you for reading have a nice day
1,the roots of fear fear is the expectation of displeasure in the widest sense in the narrowest sense fear is aversion of death every fear is fear of death fear is the expectation of unknown we fear only what is new what has become familiar to us loses the capacity to produce fear death too is to us the absolutely new and unknown for one should be able to die but once to be sure there are neurotics who die every day or at least play at dying man endures everything but not the unknown whose charactestic symbol is the dark faith fulfils a great mission by setting up a positive affirmation in place of the great question mark when a man fixed on any fearful idea life becomes hell and it feels no one understands what this man is dealing with all of us have been in fearful situations but some people are daily living this hell among the common fears people told me about fear of rejection is big when someone feels that no matter how he or she tries will be rejected so the person becomes his own rejecter and he always pull himself back fear of abandonment a person with this fear he or she always pushing away people for his life because he has doubts about why people interested in him and he has shame persona based fear of success there is some people no matter what effort they take they always fail because they fear being successful that means unconsciously to them success is bad and dangerous fear of intimate relationships a lot of people are dealing with sexual shame without being aware of that intimacy means pain and danger fear of oneself that is when a person is escaping himself all the time relying on drugs or some form of escapism such like porn working all the time gambling those are common fears that i find with my clients hope this post benefit you guys for any questions chat me peace sparkles
1,unsure how to help more i personally have been dealing with depression and a few other things for quite a few years however i am still at a loss on how to help my suicidal sister and i am looking for advice my depression has never got to the point of suicidal thoughts so i am unsure how to really help my sister is older than me and has ocd depression aspergers and ptsd my sister has been onoff suicidal for more than four years now and she is very vocal to me about it i am the only family member she will tell also almost every time i see her when i am back home she tells me that she wants to kill herself and it used to be even more often to the point where i could not focus on school anymore she also asks me for suicide methods and basically asks me for advice on how to kill herself i usually try to sit down and listen to her vent about why she is feeling that way but i feel like it never helps i have also recommended the suicide hotline as another form of help because i did not know what to do me and my other sister have had to get her checked into a psych ward a few times when she started making a suicide plan last time it happened was last week she lives with a really toxic mother not my mom and also has a lot of trauma from our dad i have tried to help her make a plan to get out of that living situation but she does not try to she also barely tells her therapist what is going on and wants to quit i am unsure what else i can do and to be honest i am getting very drained having to be told that she is going to kill herself every time she leaves my house i also have things i am dealing with this has been going on for years to the point where i avoid talking to her because i am afraid she will tell me she is going to kill herself again tldr sister suicidal for years and only tells me refuses help i do not know what to do anymore and i am very drained
1,perhaps what is worse than depression is not being able to realize if you are having the best time of your life or the worst because it all feels the same i am having a really hard time keeping up with life especially since the lockdown started i just do not feel like i have anything to live for i do not want to be happy i just do not understand what happiness is to be completely honest that is not to say that i am unhappy and miserable what i am saying is that happiness and sadness has become the same thing for me i just cannot separate the two on top of that there is this feeling of guilt i keep having about everything i am from a rich family people have always expected me to be on top of everything ever since i learned to walk but i was never able to be on top i have always sucked at everything i tried to be on top but never made it and so now i am this 21 year old uni student and i have been hammered so much with that mindset of trying to get to be best at everything and since i have always failed at that i feel safer as a failure i just do not feel that i want to succeed i have become an emotional masochist sometimes i imagine that a loved one would come and choke me to death to put me out of this misery and leave me in a cold dead end where no one would ever come across again that is not to say i am suicidal i am not i just like having those kinds of imaginations the only thing i do to keep my mind off of these feelings these days is that i listen to music even my genres are new age or shoegazing or doom metal which used to be uplifting epic music now i am not going too much into that stuff but i hope i have made my point clear i am not looking for concrete advice perhaps simply writing these down and sharing might help me a lot thank you for taking the time to read through this whole post i truly appreciate it
1,what is it called when someone is so stressed they snap at the first thing that draws their attention last night i was cooking dinner for my gf while she was setting up a sprinkler in the front yard she had been out there by herself for several minutes while i was working in the kitchen not knowing that the following factors were causing her to become stressed a weak hose that kept kinking so water would not flow through it the three neighbors dogs barking at her through the fence they were within three feet of her and trying to connect two hoses that did not want to fit when i finished getting dinner ready i happily went outside to let her know dinner was ready up to this point we had been having a lovely evening and i never suspected anything was wrong so my mental and emotional defenses were down and i was not expecting anything after i told her dinner was ready i stood waiting for some response while keeping our dog busy mowing she might get in my gfs way she turned around a yelledyou do not have to rush me and went back to doing what she was working on clearly angry i had no response and could only stammer that i was not rushing her and finally gave up and went inside and sat on the couch to figure out what had just happened this is not the first time she has snapped at me when i am not the source of stress on her but after the inevitable argument and makeup she told me how she had been stressed by all the things i had listed and believed i had come out to hurry her along to dinner she is seeing a therapist now for about a year but only once a month but i think she should be seeing them about twice a month but she always has excuses why she cannot so i want to know how i can avoid her snapping at me like that again in the future how do i keep her from getting stressed out by ordinary as i see them things
1,i need some advice for being a better bf for my gf who is going through a lot of mental health problems right now i have been with this girl for 4 months and we are both the age of 20 in college our relationship has been amazing before the past couple of weeks i am really close to losing her because i am just not good at being emotional support for her since school started in february she works part time 25 hours a week while taking 19 credits as a stem major and contributes to a sorority she has no time for anything and has just been so overwhelmed she gets about 4 hours of sleep a night and is falling behind in her classes every night she has panic attacks and is just so insanely stressed and a lot of the times she says she cannot do life and says she is going to kill herself our relationship is semilong distance i am able to visit her every other week and be able to spend time with her for 6 days i feel i am a lot better at being emotional support for her in person rather than over text or over the phone she tells me that i am making it harder for her mentally because i am just really bad at talking her through it she also says that i give her more stress because when i talk to her i make her feel bad that she is behind in her classes our relationship is on thin ice and she keeps telling me that we are not going to make it i potentially have covid so i will not be able to see her for a while i am just looking for some advice on how to talk to her i am in love with this girl and i just always see past the mentally hurt girl when she is mentally healthy she is just the sweetest funniest appreciative and loving girl we have a lot of potential in our future and i really do not want to lose that does anyone have some good advice or links for how to talk to someone who is insanely stressed and depressed

1,just totally apathetic at this stage not sad or angry any more simply do not feel anything but numbness for a long time nearly my entire life i felt a lot of anger and sadness over my situation i hated my self and everyone else i never had many friends and because i was a social outcast in my youth i am now at the age of 21 with fuck all friends those of which i am friendly with all have lives of their own and multiple friend groups to juggle so i see them only every few months while i do not meet anyone in the mean time and go about my day not talking to anyone i started taking meds and i did not notice much difference so i stopped and made a conscious effort to try to better myself i started dressing well started having a hair and skincare routine and exercising and eating right i have put on a decent amount of muscle and i look the best i have ever for the first time in my life i have noticed women looking at me and smiling as i make eye contact with them and smile back i am not a bad looking person even though for years i very much felt i was and neglected to care for myself as a result despite the validation of seeing these good looking women notice me for the first time ever it is all in vain all of my efforts are futile as we walk by each other never to see each other again i am not even afraid to talk to women like i used to be as i have a lot more confidence these days i feel as though my sudden confidence around women is tied to the fact that i am just numb and so over it all all of the effort i put into myself is in vain because nothing ever happens it was easier when i did not take care of myself did not shower eat or sleep i put in all of this effort to genuinely look pretty good and yet it is all worthless because no one stops to speak to me they look at me smile and keep walking and so do i

1,my mom died yesterday my mom died yesterday night at around 12 am she killed herself i can only assume she has schizophrenia the previous 2 weeks of her death she was acting totally different nothing of herself she was going on about god she was never religious and how if we do not believe in him we are going to hell it all began from when she was dating this guy joseph and when she came home that night she was totally different i now live with just my dad and sister and all to remind i am just 16 it really hurts she is dead all i can think about it her death i cry off and on and some moments i feel fine then others times i feel numb my family is being supportive but none of them understand this pain they remind me it was not her i know it was not her my mom would have never done this to us it does not change the fact my mom is selfish for killing herself i can still hear the gun shot in the bathroom it hurts to even go into the bathroom to even touch any of her stuff i mourn with happy pictures of her still painful to think she would change so fast i looked through notebooks of hers she used to write like it was her life she wrote lists and lists of things to do chore lists grocery lists activity listsetc it was never ending my mom was always full of life always ready to take on what life gave her she never considered suicide the night of when she killed herself she was preparing us all night it hurt to hear her talk like that she had cuts all over her body and bruises on her thighs from the 48 hours she disappeared that morning she came home naked and wrapped up in blanket apparently walking around the city i want to let every one know that no matter what cherish the people around you and take the sad things seriously never forget that that may be the last time you will see them
1,give everyone your all receive none in return even if it is a matter of life or death it is times like these where i realize that no matter how hard i try i am worth nothing to these people god forbid i talk about depression or my struggles with diabetes i have insulted them and their ancestors as well as every god known to man i hate my self for wanting validation from them i hate myself for trying to be the bigger better person i just hate my self i recently got diagnosed with diabetes we are still figuring out the proper dosage for me it is super tricky not enough meds and my blood sugar is always high enough meds my blood sugar crashes hard when i first got diagnosed my sister threw a fit about how it was basically my fault i got diabetes mind you i am a dentist other sister is a dentist other sister her bestie is a physician she has plenty of medical knowledge three hours ago she called me while i was trying to sleep i did not pick up she texted me on every platform you can think of when i answered she told me she was worried because her bf is tired and she does not know why i told her a number of things and when she asked for details i told her to freaking google it she said i was being insensitive 5 minutes later i apologized twice and went into detail 15 minutes later i hear her going up the stairs to her bedroom 5 minutes after that i feel unease check my blood sugar so low i freaked out thinking i might die there not that it would be a horrible thing but if i do go i want it to end in peace with no drama i barely get downstairs because i want to make a sugary oatmeal dish and call her to ask for help because at that point i could not see she threw a fit about me waking her up she knows how life threatening extreme blood sugar readings can be i just simply do not matter
1,does anybody else have a friendor so that is a good friend you have had a long time but every text conversation usually ends up with you feeling drained irritated and in a really bad mood alright i will try not to make this super long so basically i have been really good friends with someone for like 5 years and is always there for me to turn to when i need his help and will do about anything that i may ask always has my back etc i really value him and how he always helps me to not worry because he will never let me downbut i feel like every conversation for lack of a more fitting wordthat he is constantly cutting me off even before i get a chance to respond before he starts talking again dominating the whole conversation and bombards me text after text after text not giving me any time to reply to anything and if i do get a message in it does not make much difference on what i am feeling and trying to get across and it is only after he sends 45 texts before mine shows up in the thread before what i said was acknowledged and addressed and then after it is briefly talked about then he again just talks and talks and sends numerous texts in a row and will not fucking shutup until i get to the point of overwhelming anger taking full control over me and then i end up having an anxiety attack that does not end for at least 30mnz after i have cussed him out or attempted to and completely cut off wasting one more minute of time and quit the conversation for good feeling drained of everything and out of energy sorry this was a little longer than i expected and i hope makes sense because it is been a long really bad day and i am trying to come across as able to make sense of i would like to know if anyone has gone thru this or anything similar and what did you do that stopped it from happening ever again
1,i am teetering on the edge but i do not want to give up i am so tired everything is a struggle and any scrap of happiness feels so foreign to me i feel like i do not deserve happiness or friendship and if i do have a moment of joy i will feel guilty or undeserving shortly after i will even feel like i deserve bad things to happen to me be that deserving an anxiety attack or physical pain my anxiety is not getting any better either i constantly have a feeling of impending doom i am constantly aware of my being and life will often feel like i am watching a movie just a series of events i am not actually experiencing i am a trans guy and i want to transition but that desire is slowly dissolving i feel like i should just stop trying because i have no hope left that the future will be better i do not feel real and i do not feel like i am trans enough and i feel pathetic i feel judged by everyone and i cannot be myself because i do not know who that person is but i really do not want to give up despite having no hope left there are still things i want to see i may not have any goals but what i do have are small wishes small wishes like the wish to walk through a beautiful park on a sunny day with no worries the wish to sit on a roof and look at stars or to eat at an all night diner with friends and just laugh i think about these things a lot i want to live long enough to actually be there i never thought i would be at this point i have told people that they did not have to worry because i would never get low enough to think about suicide now that feels like so long ago maybe i do have the tiniest scrap of hope since i am still here i do not want to die i want so badly to live it is just incredibly painful i know people say you are not alone and i am not alone in what i feel but here writing this i am
1,how much is too much somebody tell me i do not even know how to begin writing but here goes my long term partner and i split a few weeks ago and i pushed him away because my mind is swimming i have got a really demanding job that recently has been piling up with more and more stress my department was gutted and i am basically the last one standing doing the work that 4 people used to do on top of that i am doing a full time accelerated mba which until this point i have been able to handle here is where it gets stupid i volunteered for a really exciting extracurricular project and got accepted yay it is a huge initiative and requires hours and hours of reading the people in my group are incredibly experienced and well versed on the topic think managing directorscorporate sustainability directors etc and i feel way out of my depth amongst them let alone contributing i have been practicing yoga 5 days a week which helps and developed an obsession with incense but my mind is constantly running on top of all of this the breakup has left me stressed emotionally and financially and i do not have a car to even to my groceries to go shopping i have to lug around huge bags on either arm and walk 20 minutes to and from the shops often in muggy and horrible weather i know a lot of it is selfinduced the extracurricular the mba the demanding job the break up but it is beyond the point of return i cannot drop one or any of these stresses i cannot keep on top of everything and feel like the only thing that relieves me is yoga but i have to do yoga in my lunch break and then i miss out on eating and am stressed that people at work are gossiping because my lunch breaks often go beyond an hour due to getting changed walking to the studio etc i needed to type that out thanks guys
1,just needing a place to vent my 2017 was just a pile of crap i had multiple family members die our dog got hit by a car i got investigated at a job and fired because someone made up rumors about me got fired from a second job for no reason and finally got into sales on strictly commission then there was a hurricane we lost our home so all of our stuff is in storage and we are living in a bedroom with family sales started good and now it is dead we have nothing we have negative hundreds of dollars in our bank account because of autopay bills with 15 cash to our name and i will not get paid again next week i do not know what else to do i have looked for other jobs but nothing matches my previous salary that we built our bills around our credit is bad and relatively new so we cannot refinance cars right now or skip payments and we cannot get loans because my partner does not make enough and i have not been at this job long enough i do not know what to do i cannot get a second job because i work nearly 52 hours a week my partner works full time and uses the downtime to do the laundry for me and run the other errands i cannot during the day i am just at an impass our family members do not have money for us to borrow we have no credit cards i just feel like everything is spiraling down and i cannot control any of it i was hoping 2018 would be better but so far it is not anyway if you have stuck with me this long thanks for listening i hate to burden my family with this kind of stuff because i feel guilty i know there are are people who have absolutely nothing i have clothes on my back and a roof over my head but i am still worried because i do not have gas money to get to work or buy groceries it is just a very helpless feeling thanks again to anyone who is reading this i appreciate you
1,i am worried i am going to disappoint my family i do not really know where to turn and i am running out of options i am in med school abroad and am embroiled in trying to earn a few more points on a major exam so that i can attend my sisters wedding which is to be held in the states the exam i failed has a make up but it is literally scheduled the day after the wedding so to travel back abroad still means i would have to miss out on the occasion which itself cannot be delayed any further i know that i am not the strongest of students but i really felt confident with the particular exam and now because of my own damn fault i may be withheld from going i just feel like i am letting everyone down like i am just destined to keep failing it is hard to talk to people close to me on this matter despite me doing so because it just goes back into this loop of you did this to yourself you need to dedicate more time to studying etc i do not disagree with the feedback but it is not helping me right now i just feel trapped update well i tried i went to the university office and it was such a farce they stopped any conversation saying their hands are tied or we are legally bound from doing including providing the answer key to said exam so that i could see where the points were lost i will not be attending my sisters wedding and will have to sit in for the make up exam i never minded sitting for the exam it is just the timing of it all i could go on about how pathetic the scheduling system is how i cannot even access the exam admit card until a few days prior to the exam but it is not going to do me any good wish me luck on this exam please you have all been very kind as for my family of course they are understanding of the situation i just feel horrible letting them down
1,stress is bizarre this is the first time in my life i have had to deal with real stress i am 17 and am leaving for a 5 month volunteer program in two days i have to fly across the country on my own where i will meet the group of strangers who i will be spending the next five months with this on its own is very very stressful i have social anxiety and i will have to leave my family the longest i have been away from my parents is a week but because i am leaving in early january this meant finishing all my classes early i barely studied over the winter break i did two tests today which i think i did okay on but i have all my exams tomorrow plus another test i am screwed i have been trying to cram all the information i can into my brain but i feel too fatigued and strained for any of it to even make sense and i just discovered a new unit of material in the study guide my teacher gave me which i did not even know existed until now and that will be a big chunk of the exam tomorrow i am bound to end up with a very poor grade which is in biology the path i want to pursue in university how the hell can i imagine getting into university if i cannot even do okay in the high school class i only identified the issue i have been struggling with as being stress a couple days ago i said before then ugh i am stressed out and whatever but i did not know what that really meant until now it took a while for me to link the racing mind insomnia gastrointestinal troubles racing heartbeat restlessness diffuse concentration low cognitive performance disorganization forgetfulness and low immune system as all stemming from the same issue until then i never would have thought these could possibly be related until i looked up symptoms of stress out of curiosity damn every one was bang on crazy
1,just burst into tears at work so i have been with my company for 16 years always loved it good at my job if i do say so myself in january i got a big promotion to supervisor last month i got another to a salaried management position i am quarterbacking a very major project involving integrating our facility with a corporate call center it is going to change daily life for us forever we are launching this week guys we are around ten people short there is no way we can even do basic daily functionality much less all the crazy shit this project entails i am working 12 hours a day at least 5 days a week and usually going in for 510 hours over the weekend i am working so much just to fill holes because there is literally nobody else to do it all my people are working overtime and burned the fuck out i came in at 4am to do some stuff nobody else was able to do last night and then i was working on payroll and looking at this absolute abortion of a schedule any i could not help but burst into tears in front of my crew not like ugly crying but stoic like silent tears i am exasperated i am not an emotional guy but i feel like i am having a nervous breakdown i am being an asshole to my family on the rare occasion i ever see them it is causing a lot of problems but my field is extremely limited not many opportunities around here for me i am just a schlub with no degree and an easy certification and i feel like i am drowning if i had people it would be easy but getting people in here takes months with this slothlike corporate structure i seriously am just sitting in my car on the side of a country road right now just not knowing what to do i am feeling completely spent and empty thinking about the place makes me want to cry again ah well feels a little better to just talk about it
1,i told him no and he got pissed my uncle asked me to take him a couple places today and i told him no i cannot take you right now he knocked on my door at around 6 in the morning to ask me to take him out 6 in the morning i am fucking half naked inching the door open while this man asks me at 6 in the morning if i can take him out to a couple places today i said no i am in the middle of finals i know a couple places means 5 places that i will spend an hour each in i said no and he said alright i thought that was the end of it i get back in bed an hour later he is slamming shit in the kitchen slamming doors closed downstairs till finally he comes up to me again pounding on the door asking me to take him somewhere i said no and he started fucking screaming over the word no he eventually said nevermind and a second later he is walking out the door slamming the door on his way out over the word no but when i tell my parents this i am the wrong one for getting him upset and not succumbing to what he wants my dad asked me the other day if i still had my depression what the fuck does he think edit thank you for all the solidarity i oftentimes feel like i am an asshole and run myself into circles wondering what i did wrong in each and every moment how i could have prevented a negative confrontation from my family by simply being agreeable with them i struggle with this and the friends i have do not always fully understand where i am coming from all of the time so it is nice seeing that i am not insane over denying someone else i managed to get a go ahead from a friend to stay at his place for the weekend to cool off because i am starting to spiral and am quickly heading to a place i do not want to be thanks again for taking the time to actually listen to what i am saying
1,i found a unsent letter from my mom to my grandma and now i am heartbroken my mom is away on vacation and i know she has some edibles hidden in her drawer so i thought it would be a good idea to steal a couple while she was gone i know i should not have been doing that but that is honestly not important to me right now sorry while grabbing the jar of gummies i found a note right next to it the note reads as a letter that my mom wrote to her mom who passed away about 15 years ago the tldr of the letter is that my mom wished she knew the things she knows now as a parent when she was younger because she never appreciated how hard her mom worked for her she went into how she thinks she failed me because of my depression i am open with my depression to my mom and she is supportive and that being a parent is hard but she is trying her best but her best is not enough my mom has never spoken to me about her depression although she has mentioned it very briefly but reading that letter broke me harder than anything i can remember i just started bawling still am while writing this my mom is the most important thing to me in the world and learning that she thinks she is a failure makes me have suicidal thoughts because of how broken i feel about this but now i feel the pressure of making my mom proud and making sure she feels like she is not a failure so obviously suicide is off the table at least until after she passes i just do not know if i have it in me to turn things around my depression has been the same ever since i was diagnosed with it in hs i am 26 now i am going to try to go out of my way and hug her more and tell her i love her and how much i appreciate her but i do not think i will ever get over knowing how she really feels about herself thanks for reading i needed to vent
1,feeling beaten today started so well and has ended so poorly my wife went to enrol on her college course today and did so only for a few hours later the college to basically pull the plug on this plan by denying us the funding for childcare that we need for her to be able to attend her course we are on benefits here in the uk as she raises our little boy whilst i go out and work full time as a teaching assistant so on low wages i am enrolled on an open university masters that starts in october and she was going to go and do hairdressing at college this was supposed to be the start of us working our way out of the not so great financial situation we have in a few years i would have my masters and be able to pursue a career working with children like i have always wanted to that earns me far more money than i currently do my wife was going to be able to do her dream of being a ta for the part time hours most ta jobs offer and be a hairdresser on the side to earn a bit more money for us this was going to be the better life we had always wanted and always wanted for our two children and allow us to have a third if we wanted one but the college pulling the plug has just crushed us both her because it means she cannot do the course she wants to do and better herself the way she wants to and me because it feels i have sunk into this rut of thinking that whenever we try to look forward and be optimistic and things seem to be going well for us it all comes crashing down around us and falls through i cannot shake this feeling that no matter how positive and optimistic we can get it is always going to fall apart i cannot shake this feeling that no matter how hard we try we are not going to be able to get out of a benefits system i am beginning to feel like we are trapped in this really sucks

1,high school hi i searched for many subreddits to let out my feelings and i felt like this was the most appropriate i am currently a senior in high school and worked through an enormous amount of stress and hardwork for the last 3 years i took 12 ap and honors classes was captain of the robotics team on student council and much more there were many many days when i stayed up until 2 or 3 in the morning studying for tests getting stressed out about grades teachers overloading us with home work trying to make my parents proud and more importantly myself proud i went into this school year a happy dude just finished 3 hardworking stressful years of high school and hope to get into at least 1 college that i wanted 2 weeks ago i learned that i got denied to every college i wanted to go to except 1 and i got waitlisteddeferred these past two weeks i have felt useless depressed and most of all stressed out i have had this feeling in my head that just makes me feel like i am about to pass out i have felt like there was basically there was no point in doing anything anymore i have just been going through the motions of life on the outside looking happy on the inside just stressed out of my mind i thought i experienced stress before but nothing is like this i have tried so many ways of relaxing but everything just makes me so stressed i sure as hell do not want pity and i am not making excuses i just needed to let it all out i did not really know what to do my parents do not really care that i am stressed they just tell me that there is no reason to be stressed i think that is what makes me stressed more than anything the fact that i go to my parents and think they tell me that i can just turn it off like it has an off switch i just needed somewhere to let it out
1,i disappointed everyone that expected great things from me when i was attending high school i was top of my class with a dream of attending an ivy league university particularly mit all my teachers were extremely proud of me my parents were excited for my future in education my peers thought highly of me however once the middle of my junior year came i was faced with an overwhelming mental breakdown and fell into a depression i would spend sleepless nights doing schoolwork with already unstable mental health or i would do completely nothing and think i eventually started to think about why i am doing this and realized that i do not like this traditional route i am going on nor will the results of it make me happy as i am already depressed doing the things i should like doing at that moment my life lost its meaning near the end of my junior year into senior i stopped taking care of myself developed insomnia due to my obligation to try and keep up with my ap classes and my thoughts relentlessly wandering and slept in all my classes my teachers parents and peers as a result started looking down at me wondering why i became such a disappointment according to my principal when i wanted to lighten my workload this put me in the deepest depression of my life as i felt i failed everyone and destined to be nothing i would resort to cutting myself drinking taking old prescription pills and withhold from eating as a way to punish myself to make this short i decided to make my main way of attaining happiness is music that is my dream everyone is still disappointed in me and it weighs heavy on me i wish it could go away this was more of a medium to vent instead of ask for help as i am not feeling well at the moment thank you if you actually do read this

1,this year how many of you all have had an exceptionally crappy year just a series of unfortunate events nonstop i have always had anxiety issues and will literally not sleep or eat until a problem is at least subdued if not resolved yet i have also been very very adept at avoiding nonsense and misery in general all up until this year it started with covid making life a bit difficult we a share that issue though a bit later in the year a very close family member attempts suicide and that alone brought so many issues that lasted a few months after that episode my 8 year old cat my best little dude passed away due to severe anemia and i spent 3k of my savings trying to save him now i have what potentially could be a blood disorder if not possible maybe future leukemia family members have had that shit i have slept maybe 10 hours in the last 3 days and for the first time in years i am terrified and also for the first time in a long time i broke down in tears for a few hours earlier wishing my cat was here i miss the fuck out of him i live by the moto it could always be worse but now this time it seems it probably will get worse this year seems to get weirder and weirder i had so many plans set for this year i wanted to get a house take my cat out for car rides more get a better job get a home gym run more fix my truck up go out with friends and maybe find a woman to share my time with all of that snuffed out and it took my cat with it i am in my late 20s and i bust my ass of for my health and wellness and now even that is under heavy threat i am definitely not the only one with these issues i probably have it great to some of you it sure does seem odd that this all happens this year though as if darkness is catching up how are you all doing
1,my boyfriend is severely depressed and sent me the following texts please tell me what should i do it breaks my heart to see him like this he talks about our relationship and his life situation in general pd he recently started going to therapy the texts there are acts that can be very valuable but to no avail i have known for months that it is a lost and absurd battle that is not worth fighting and things have happened accordingly and got worse we could not do it separately nor together we could not do it in more favorable situations we cannot do it now it would simply be absurd it would be better for you to dedicate your time to yourself or anything else it is simply useless already it was useless half a year ago and it is now more than ever there is no need on making a great effort if it has to be useless i consider the help not yours but from anyone useless given the situation and i think time has proved me right everything has gone from bad to worse it would be absurd to think that things could work out in december i told you that no matter how much you wanted it was not viable that it would become a struggle between you and depression and that we could not win in any way and everything has happened like this i am able to distinguish my thoughts from reality yet it is very heartbreaking to see him like this he has said these things to me many times so it does not come as a surprise to me that he thinks this way but it is still hard he always ends up coming back to me and i want to be supportive of him and do whatever i have to do best so it allows him to feel at least a bit safer with me 59 feel that he is actually not alone and that getting better is not impossible but he keeps pushing me away what should i really do

1,how to take life less seriously hi all i 24 m am new to this sub but i think i am in the right place for this post basically i have had an absolute shit year last june i lost my father suddenly to an overdose we did not know this at the time we only found out months later and it came as a shock because we had no idea he even had a drug problem to begin with anyway his death caused a massive ripple effect in our family and being his oldest son i have had to step into some big shoes i found myself caught in between drama involving my dads mom and my own mom while also having to be there for my younger brother 19 my parents owned a restaurant and following my dads death the building landlord forced us out because he wanted the building for himself so after learning the results of the toxicology report we had to scramble to close the restaurant down and get out of the building before the landlord tried suing us again to help my mom with the restaurant closing i had to leave my job which i hated anyway and now i am applying to dental school another very involved and stressful process while looking for a new job long story short i just feel like there are a lot of people depending on me all the time now and it feels like a lot of pressure i constantly feel as though i am behind the eight ball and with each passing day i get more and more stressed out i am just worried that if i cannot handle this type of pressure now how will i juggle a career and a family of my own on top of all this i was wondering if anyone had any tips on how to stay in the moment and take life less seriously and enjoy it i find myself putting so much pressure on every decision i make and it ends up stressing me out to the point where i am miserable to be around
1,money games nonsense so i stress about the worst stuff things i should not be stressed about i have recently spent 300 on a roleplaying game for deluxe cars and i am now starting to regret it realising that i might not stay on that server for less than a year so i am thinking to myself what was the point i just put 300 in the trash because since they are my only friends and they leave then i would be alone and would not want to stay in that server and then i would not be able to savor the cars that i spent 300 on i am also stressing about the same server i only have 3 friends in that server some might leave in like a month or two some might leave in a year so i want to spend as much time with them as i can same thing for the 300 i spent i had to decide to get a job in game and wanted to be a police officer which i thought was really cool but in a previous situation the work of a police man in that server was really stressful which i realised from one annoying guy so i wanted to quit and be a prison guard which is not that much of a fun job but i would be with my four friends who work together there my dad irl told me that i should not quit something because of one annoying person since there are a lot of people who are going to be annoying in my life i stress about multiple other things but those are not what are stressing me that much now anymore i love this server and i want to continue playing on it i have vowed not to use that much money a game ever again which is already a start but what has been done is done and i have decided to work with my friends even if the job is not that cool because i want to spend time with them but i still cannot stop stressing about all of it does anyone have any ways to not stress about things like this overall

1,i think my wife saved my life this morning i have severe anxiety taking meds but they have kind of stopped working like they used to got into a conversation with my wife yesterday and i mentioned if i were to be in a place where i could just sit still and not have my brain worry about something i do not know what i would do with myself anyway i do not get into depressive moods too often anymore it this morning 3 days before our 5th anniversary vacation we never take vacations never have the money i check my bank account and realize that all of the bills i had planned to come out last week all hit at once and put our account into the negative by quite a bit i panicked my wife had been looking forward to a small trip to chattanooga to just relax for months the kid was to stay at my parents house and we were just going to relax for a few days when i realized i messed up the timing on our bills i spiraled i absolutely lost control and cried lost it it was probably the worst i have ever felt i was crying for about 10 minutes when i suddenly had this sense of calm wash over me suicide easy i got out of bed suddenly stoped crying cleaned my face up and began getting dressed i told my wife i was going out for a little while she knew something was going on and refused to let me leave the house she physically grabbed me made me look her in the eyes and told me everything was fine it brought me out of my head i do not know if it is something that i would have gone through with but in that moment it was the most ok i had ever been with the idea of suicide we still do not have the money for the trip but that is ok i know i have someone looking out for me sorry for the rambling but i figured i just needed to get it out of my head

1,how to overcome ptsd in a new relationship straight to the point when i was 16 i was in a toxic relationship where my ex boyfriend 22 at the time attempted to manipulate me into refraining from speaking to my male best friends and i almost lost them in the process trying to fulfill his desires being the people pleaser i am this among other toxic shit resulted in trauma my current boyfriend is completely different he is a sweetheart but sometimes my male best friends behaviors tick him off usually it is not anything major just stuff that my boyfriend finds annoying like overly friendly physical contact and whatnot he would point that out and i out of fear of repeating the traumatizing past i had with my ex would go on to defendjustify their actions in a way it seems like i am attacking him or forcing my opinions and friendships down his throat it had become a reoccurring problem of me continuously defending my friends and unintentionally putting them above my relationship in fear that i might lose them again and end up alone in case we ever break up sometimes my boyfriend would lose his temper during those arguments after having them for more than one or two times and that resulted in more fear on my part i know he is not trying to do the same shit my ex tried to pull off but it is not something i can easily control yesterday he told me that he is starting to feel like i do not prioritize him in the relationship he said he feels like a second option if anything at all and this contributed in his depression he does not think it is going to work out anytime soon in terms of this specific topic how should i deal with it and what is your advice to overcome the ptsd i have from my past experience with a toxic relationship

1,i feel beyond suicidal anybody else have this suicide just feels completely pointless infact everything does people try to cheer you up and all they do is tell you to be practical and to stop being dramatic when you are not even showing any emotion the first place and all you are doing is lying there like a dead fish killing yourself is just another desperate solution to something that cannot be fixed and even then suicide does not do anything except because more pain to people not even dying seems appealing anymore at this point i just want to lie in bed and sleep and keep sleeping and keep sleeping but i cannot even be afforded the option of giving up if i do people tell me i am selfish and stick pitchforks in me i ask why and the best answer i get for keeping going is just because you have to and then people get angry when you press them further because they cannot really think of a reason either it is just a blind desperation to survive we all have like we are just that important that need to survive other people have seems to have disappeared from me and so has the need to die i am stuck here in this place and all i want to do is block it all out sometimes i do not even want to get out of bed to piss we keep going because we have to but nobody ever tells me why edit wow 13k upvotes and an award this is the first post i have ever made here on this sub and you have all made me feel really welcome so thank you very much i am glad so many people get it i knew i was not the only one out there who felt like this but to see the amount of traction this got and just how many people understood this makes me feel so much less alone i wish i could thank each one of you individually thanks for being there reddit 3
1,falling back into severe depression with responsibilities hello friends throwaway for reasons i really needed a place to let this out besides therapy i will try to keep specifics to a minimum as my social circle browses the subreddit occasionally and is not something i am currently sharing with all of them a short backstory ever since high school i have suffered from various severities of depression this peaked in 20182019 when i attempted to take my own life on two occasions and luckily failed both times without serious repercussions health wise fast forward a year or two i have a child with a woman who i am no longer with and fatherhood has been absolutely amazing i know it is cliche but it really is life changing i would not give it up for anything while things have been mostly civil with coparenting as you can imagine issues arise more often than with a couple who is together i have really tried to let things roll off and keep things as positive as i can for the kiddos sake but the last couple months those old feelings have started to sneak back in especially when there is some kind of conflict with the mother i find myself in a very guilt ridden situation i feel awful whenever the thoughts of taking my life creep back in especially when i am a father now i always push them down out of pure guilt for thinking them because i love my child and cannot imagine life awaywithout them in a lot of ways it is worse than before because i always told myself i had a way out and i feel like i do not have that option anymore rightly has anyone else dealt with this i know i am not alone in the world and my feelings are not entirely unique i just needed to get it out somewhere it helps thanks for listening
1,depression is the hot funny meme until you are not sleeping not eating and hoping you will die in a car accident i never understood why so many people see depression as something we can all joke about so fucking carelessly and casually like it is funny and relatable to see tweets and memes about how much depression sucks but it really does so much harm than good does not it i cannot understand how this is just so commonplace i laugh at them they are funny i see myself in them and then for hours and days upon days i lock myself in my car with a vague numbness ditching class or calling off work to just what stare off into a void and roll around uncomfortably in my drivers seat in a shitty parking lot chew through a pack of cigarettes and just try to settle down suicidal compulsions i stare in the rearview mirror and gastation bathrooms for forty minutes trying to make sense of who is looking back and why the sight of that person makes my stomach churn i do not sleep for days on end until i collapse i lose weight in 7 pound intervals the thoughts of being a fuckup and how bad i would beat the shit out of myself if i met myself on the street just stew any time i am beside myself it is so funny so quirky and relatable if this is relatable that is fucking tragic being a ball of despondency and wanting to break my bones with a baseball bat is something i want everyone to laugh at with me it is three am here and i am just having a cigarette in an empty bathroom tub because i do not want to think about anything i wish there was a way to turn brains off medications have not worked and i do not like being medicated at all anyway it feels like hitting a plaster wall anytime i try to feel anything sure is loads of fun
1,trying medication againa needed ramble hi i am new here i have battled with depression for maybe 15 years or more i do not even know the last year has been so much worse for me and it has nothing to do with covid i am honestly sick of hearing about covid my grandmother died a year ago and i feel like that is when things made a turn for the worse her death was horrible it was not sudden but it was not expected her health took a turn for the worse out of nowhere and she slowly died and i had to watch everyday for two months it was traumatizing my anxiety had become so unbearable i reached out to my asshole doctor for medication and got prescribed prozac which i had used before and it helped this time it helped but then i found it started making me incredibly angry and worse so i went off and tried to just deal with it because there are good days where i do feel fine but then it started happening again so i reached out to a psychotherapist she helped me to acknowledge how shitty of a childhood i had so now more trauma has been brought up i feel so overwhelmed with things in my life as well like working night shiftswhich i should be getting off soon hopefully a renovation to our only bathroom that started in april and still is not done body image issues like crazy i have 1 friend but i try not to vent to her because i hate being so negative all the time friends are so hard to make for me anyway i have a lot going on i made the call to my doctor again to try a different medication and cried to his receptionist while my husband just stood there and did not comfort at all he actually just left the room as i cried in a ball anyway i will wrap this up as i should probably go to sleep in prep for work ugh
1,could my husband be depressed how could i help long story short we have been together for 15 years his family is pure academics both parents and siblings are phds and postdocs from prestigious schools i later learned that his mom had been suffering from depression very early on and had been taking medication for a long time his sister is also depressed to a point that she could not go to class and do home work his mom had to fly to her school to watch her she is still taking medication my husband on the other hand is also a little crazy he always have very unrealistic ideas and it was all talks no action of any sorts i am really tired of just being the listener and know it is pure talk i am a little angry right now because we just had an argument i am pregnant in my third trimester and he was keep saying the house we live in is shit the weather is too hot the whole place is shit he had no friends and no jobs the world is collapsing and he wanted to abandon me to live in a mountain by the lake in chattanooga he just stopped taking coffee and it could be just his withdrawal symptoms that is another thing his mom his sister and himself were all extremely addicted to alcohol and caffeine they all tried other drugs in schools but i do not think they are taking them anymore we always have arguments whenever he is drinking too much or having withdrawals i wish i could just deal with it once and not all the time this emotion ups and downs i wish he could go to a therapist and get tested but he is too proud to do it he says i am the one that has mental problems i do not drink alcohol or caffeine or smoke or have done any drugs in my life and i do not have any family history mental illness

1,universities really do not care i am sure covid has been extra stressful for everyone countless people have lost their jobs their health has deteriorated and i am sure students can relate that online classes have been extremely stressful i do also understand where the professors stand they had to shift their whole life to sitting in front of a computer to teach to a bunch of unenthusiastic students who will not even turn their cameras on but at the same time we too are overpaying for an educational experience that is not an experience at all sitting at our computers all day rushing to finish deadlines and studying for tests and just staying focused is hard while managing work that is just the cherry on top i do have some professors who have been very understanding and have helped a lot curving grades providing extra credit then we have my stats professor he bases our grades so heavily on the tests 2 tests and 1 final i have no idea what grade i have but i know i am failing along with the rest of my class i have never done this badly in school ever i have never failed a class to say the least not understanding to our circumstances as an international student having to be awake at 3am to focus of math is a feat i have emailed him expressing my concerns no reply and its not just me the entire class is failing i have enrolled in the same class with a different professor for next semester in case i do not make it which i will not unless he curves it a whole 10 the amount of stress that is just waiting to blow up is insane and i cannot do anything to help my thoughts keep circulating back and fixating on that one thing how do you guys manage stress and anxiety i have tried almost everything
1,people stressed me by tolding me to stop being stressed how to deal with stress today i was easily stressed and angry when i was a kid each time it happens my family give me little sentence like calm yourself why are you stressing over x i am not stressed for x why are you angry am i angry no so you should not be angry you will have health issues if you continue to be stressed you will have issue in your work if you are angry they never try to resolve the reason why i was stressed or angrythat is another issue only to fix the stress in a condescending way and all their little phrases increased my stress and my anger exponentially today i am a 35 adult women and fortunately no one including those who previously do do not say this to me anymore some of them even admit to me they used those to increase my angry for fun at this time and that they are sorry for that i knew that but it did not help the issue is today each time i am stressed or angry i still hear those advice in my head it is still stress me even more angryme even more and can make me cry that happen no matter what was the original stress was about i can cry because my bus is late because it will trigger some memory like the time i was told i should not be angry for missing a bus because it was my fault of missing the bus but i can support the pression of talking in front of 400 persons for 1 hour because it will not trigger any old memory it is also hard to explain to other why i am such a stress mess sometime but able to support a lot othertime consequently somepeople think i am faking my stress any idea how to deal with stress when the simple fact of stress dealing trigger some old trauma
1,feeling i need to vent about life in general i just feel like i need to vent i am 31 and currently living with my narc mom after covid hit i lost my job and out of desperation made the choice to move back i have both an autoimmune disorder lupus and currently dealing with major depression the combination of the two means that i deal with lots of fatigue and that a lot of times i do not really strongly feel like doing much of anything though i do force myself to get outside and i am functional enough to i take care of the basic needs like daily hygiene and buying and making food for myself recently it has just been feeling very oppressive i am in sort of a paradoxical position where i wish i was not all alone all the time i do not really have any local friends yet the depression keeps me from wanting to go and hang out with people i have anhedonia which means i do not really feel positive emotions such as joy and love but i am able to feel negative emotions such as frustration hurt and anger i struggle with self hate and when its at its worst i feel like i hate almost everyone i have been living in the same small town city now for about 15 years i know it would not cure my depression but honestly a lot of times i wish i could just see different scenery i am currently working on my masters in teaching when i first started out i felt on top of the world and then right after my first semester the major depression hit after a mental breakdown being on medication has helped and i have been able to get better since the initial breakdown but now i am left worrying how am i going to have the motivation to make it through the rest of the program i am tired and sometimes all i want to do is just sleep
1,advice needed i just broke down because of stress pretty much the title i am a 22 year old dental hygiene student besides my study demanding a lot of time energy and effort it definitely does not help that i have to force myself to work extra because i am broke another thing that does not help is that i have not seen my long distance partner in almost a year since this school year started i have been under non stop stress in november i felt like i was extremely close to a big breakdown and potentionally a burnout but i somehow managed to dodge that bullet since that i have been trying to fake it until i make it except it is getting really hard now to pretend that everything is ok last semester i barely passed my exams which disappointed me i always aim to get good results and i get disappointed and feel guilty when i do not the last exams of this year are coming up next to that i have 5 other deadlines and an internship to finish all in 2 weeks time every morning i wake up in sheer panic trying to remember what day it is to get myself mentally prepared for deadline stress study stress work stress or performance stress sometimes a combination of two three or all of them i do not even know if this was the right place to post it but i had to let it out somewhere i do not feel comfortable opening up to my parents and my partner does not seem to understand me very much when it comes to these type of things if anyone has experienced something similar or has an idea of something i could try that could potentially help me get through the upcoming 2 weeks of hell i would love to hear it thanks for even taking a few minutes out of your day to read my venting post it is very much appreciated
1,i am going to kill myself over the weekend i do not know why i am writing this probably just to vent i will take any advice but please do not ask me to not do it i know nobody will read this but here it goes i am 15 and i have attempted suicide multiple times since the age of 7 i have had social anxiety for a few years now and i do not care how painful death is it is better than the torture this is sorry if that sounds cringe due to the social anxiety i have no social connections of any type outside of my single mother i have not gone through anything bad in my life but i do not think you really need a justification for killing your self other than it is what i have chosen to do if my social anxiety went away i would want to live to the rest of my life but it is impossible to get rid of yes i have tried medication and therapy it is become really painful seeing my old freinds continue to move on with their lives while i am here alone with no life i just cannot handle another day of this and the only way forward is suicide again any advice would be appreciated and if you guys recommend anything i have not tried yet i will definitely take your advice if it gives me a second chance at living edit thank you to everyone for the support i still cannot bare the thought of going on another week there just is not anything in my life that is worth living for and i am sorry to disappoint everyone again thank you for everyone is efforts to comfort me and i appreciate it so much hope everyone has a good week update i have been talking to lots of people who reached out i still do not really want to go on but i feel like i should try some of the things people suggested i guess i take back my last edit
1,i am going to blow a gasket i am a male 16 years old and a junior in high school i go to a private college prep school with very very very challenging work it is only been a week of school and i am already shaking from stress and i am on the verge of having a breakdown every day i yelled at my girlfriend for the first time since we started dating almost 5 months ago in a fit of frustration and i immediately burst into tears i am having to sacrifice 23 hours a night to homework after 7 hours of school and i cannot stand it i am dropping ap yous history which i thought i was looking forward to because of how much work it is but even without apush i am still swamped with work in all my classes my grades are already dropping and i barely have time to do the things that actually bring my any sort of happiness and i feel so weak because of it everyone else is just carrying on like it is no big deal they know it is a lot and they push forward they take the challenge head on and make it through they actually contribute to classes unlike me who just sits there silently freaking out and taking notes to save my life and i am not even in as many hard classes nor do i do as many extracurricular activities as some of if not most of my peers some people even poked fun at me when i said i was thinking about dropping ap yous history i feel like such a goddamn quitter and an idiot but this is just too much for me i came home every day last week super frustrated and stressed it is only been one week i do not know if so can deal with 9 months of this without having a huge mental breakdown i am so close to blowing a gasket i hope i am in the right place to let all this anxiety and frustration out
1,i hate how fast i go from being okay to empty and depressed i was doing fine this past month i have been getting up early and being productive and just being okay for once i started talking to this girl and things were perfect we have lots in common and we seem to be on the same boat on things i have not been in a relationship in a while but she made it clear she wants to be with me in time yesterday i invited her to hang out with my friends and i and she was just so different than she is when we are alone when i tried to hold her hand she did not let me afterwards she texted me and said she is not ready after all and realized it when i tried to show affection in front of my friends we have only been talking for about 2 weeks so it did not completely destroy me but i just always get attached quick so i am still upset about it it seems like every person i see myself with always tends to end things for one reason or another and i am over it being a front line worker is exhausting as it is but having a failed almost relationship again is messing with my head and i am starting to feel the darkness overwhelm my thoughts when i have spent the majority of the last few years working on fixing that it is hard when i put all my effort into people that do not do the same back you know when you stare into nothing and start overthinking everything about your life i am starting to think i am the problem behind all these failed relationships i know she is not worth it i do not think it is her specifically making me feel this way as much as the patterns that keep occurring in my love life i do not know what to do anymore tdlr things were fine until they were not and i just do not know what to do anymore
1,what is going on with me i was diagnosed with depression about 3 months ago but recently about a months ago i went from being just normal to literally yelling at my dad i am amazing idgaf what you do to me and i was really genuinely doing amazing i was really cocky i was not taking my pills i know that sounds dumb but it was making me feel worse i felt like i was on top of the world and these pills stabilized me and everyone who was close to me was saying i was acting off even though inside i was doing amazing and i felt like i climbed a mountain i also could not really sleep i slept for about 4 or 5 hours at most for this little period i also felt like these random thoughts coming all over the place were coming to me through god i went through my memory and realized this happened alot to me at all kinds of points in my life it happened when i was about 11 and looking back i was definitely acting like a huge dick i screamed at my friends that i am amazing they are worse than me blah blah so they all stopped talking to me because i am my eyes i was like jesus spreading my truth and trying to show everyone the world i live in i also could not sleep during this time i honestly do not know if this is a symptom of depression or if i am just a dick at heart but i find this really really weird and for the first time i noticed this is actually a problem i went from feeling great to feeling so depressed and suicidal in one month i honestly do not know what is going on with me but i really need advice for this i got a doctors appointment just tomorrow so of course i am going to tell them about this but i also want other people who have depression to put on their view on it
1,i am searching for my path in life but cannot seem to find it sorry ahead of time for the rambling on there is alot on my mind and its hard to put in words i am a 18yo male i recently graduated high school i am searching for my path in life but cannot seem to find it throughout highschool i had 2 or 3 jobs part time gas station restaurant jobs that i actually did not hate after graduation i got a job working for a home building company making about 19hr does not sound bad until you are the one working the 50hr weeks lifting 250lb walls for 10 hours a day i just walked out on that job 3 days ago i could not take it anymore that job would have allowed me to move out of my parents home but it was way too much work for not enough money heaven forbid i have a kid or something and i would not be able to afford bills and be able to care for the child at the same time so that job was not an option and the typical minimum wage 9 to 5 is not an option i am scared of going to college because of how poorly i did in highschool and the cost of it i researched gunsmithing trade schools however it seems like you can only get jobs that pay less than 20hr and its hard factory work i am good at building computers but there is no job just for building computers guns and computers are the only thing i am good at really i thought about working somewhere simple and then opening a liqour store when i am 21 but it turns out that its extremely costly and difficult to get the proper licensing for that basically i am asking is there any way i can start my own buisiness preferably firearms or computers that will not cost an arm and a leg to start up or if there is any jobs that pay well and do not make you want to die
1,having a bad day ahh damnit it is that day that comes now and then is not it or that day that keeps coming every day and keeps you in bed depression is very personal you may be having a shit month because your sister died your boyfriend of 7 years cheated on you your cat was run over your boss fired you and now you have to get rid of your car fuck sake life is shit hey why does everyone else have it so god damn easy yes i know the africans do not have water but my pain is real and i cannot carry on i do not want you to read this and carry on moping and feeling sorry for yourself you are not a victim get over it as soon as you read this turn off your phone and embrace the open air and walk outside i do not care if your at work it is raining you are somewhere important just do it when you are outside slap yourself really hard on the face or ask someone to do it feel some pain on your face splash water in your face you are not dead you are still alive very alive tomorrow can be shit hell your dad died last week maybe your mom will die tomorrow but tomorrow is a chance of not changing your life like we are in some hollywood movie tomorrow is a chance maybe to have 1 smile maybe a hug maybe your friend might make you laugh on the phone depression is the inability to face our reality we cannot face it and we therefore just shut off and wither until we end up slitting the wrist face it now and fight depression is the hardest battle to face but the easiest to win it is just beating urself you beat urself by letting go i am just some dickhead on the internet trying to help people not medical advice but i just love people red_heart
1,mind is racing and i cannot stop over thinking everything feeling in despair about everyone and everything i have been unemployed for a year after working in a highly stressful job and at the same time coming to terms that i was diagnosed with anxietydepression in the midst of it all and figuring out i have had it since i was 13 but never acknowledged or understood why i felt like a outsider 247 i tend to push people i care about away when i want time to myself even though i hate the distance i do not mean to but i do because i over think everything and my anxiety creates things that are not even there then it manifests into something that is on loop until i just keep sinking and on top of that the depression really just sends me to such a irrational overly emotional and unstable person that cannot contain my thoughts and i just completely spiral till i feel so hopeless that i just lay there and cry in frustration this week has really been tough and i do not know who to invest in my best friend who knows about my depression is always there for me but he has found some new friends which i think has triggered me to believe that just like some of my other friends he will just forget about me and decide its all too hard i think that is what i fear because then i will be completely alone and it is like losing the light in this dark room that keeps me a float sorry if this is really long it took me 40 minutes to type that as my brain is a scattered mess i tried putting it the best way that i could as it feels like i am multitasking 6 things at once if somebody could please help me or give me suggestions on managing things at least i would be forever grateful as i am losing myself completely
1,i am just a huge disappointment hello just wanted to make a post because today was a pretty sad day for me i woke up this morning and went to the bathroom as its usually the first thing i do every morning and when i walked out i overhead my dad talking to my sister about not ending up like me obviously this hurt and usually i do not cry much but this morning i cried like a bitch hearing my dad say that to my sister really fucking hurts ugh he says that he loves me but sometimes i do not know how true that is i just wish that i did not exist i have been depressed for years and nothing has changed i have lost nearly all my friends because i am a complete loser who is addicted to smoking pot because its the only thing that can temporarily cover up the sadness i am starting college soon and my parents do not have any faith in me and honestly i do not have any faith in myself i could barely pass high school because i have 0 motivation how in the world would i be able to pass through college i do not know how much longer i can take this shit i have seen a therapist but she just told me and my parents that my internet use was the problem like really she was completely useless and i have not seen one since i live in a nice house in a nice neighborhood and i have everything i could want a gaming pc a high end smartphone a puppy and life still is just as mundane as usual the only thing i have to look forward too anymore is smoking a bowl at night fuck i am starting to get suicidal thoughts and this is becoming really scary i do not really know why i am making this post i just wanted to get it all out i guess i am just tired of being a lonely loser who has 0 skills i guess
1,i am sick of being so lonely i never liked social interactions much throughout my high school years even after high school i avoided people i avoided all kinds of social interactions i had very low self esteem and i enjoyed just playing games and staying at home as years passed i realized i put myself in a very bad place and i am literally craving some human interaction like for fuck sake i literally have no friends from my own city i have no one to go out with i have a friend who fucking calls me when he needs something fuck that i have a camera that i bought and i barely took any pictures because i do not have a person to even practice portraits on i am so fucking lonely it is crazy and no matter how hard i try i am never lucky to build any type of social life i just want to be normal i just need one person that is itto go out with me make me feel normal talk it is just one person why cannot i have that i do not know what to do anymore i am 24 and time is passing how many more years am i going to waste how can i go on trips alone what the fuck do you do when you go on a trip alone it is fucking awkward everyone else is with someone and you are alone i literally do not go out anymore i feel disgusting i feel inferior i am always alone i become embarrassed i dress fucking well my hygiene is not bad i am very nice to people so what the fuck is the problem here i am never negative irl i try my best to be cheerful even if i am in a bad mood i used to go to the gym everyday until lockdown people do not socialize there what the hell do i do to have a social life you know i have decided that from now in a year if it does not get better i want to kill myself

1,i want to die but i do not want to die can anyone else relate to this every day plays out the same way bored out of my mind extremely unmotivated to do anything i am sure that if i keep going forward i may reach something that may make me happy eventually but that would take so much work way too much for me how could someone like me achieve something so big when i get tired just from performing tasks required to live i am almost tired 247 wake up get out of bed eat food maybe take a shower ok i have had enough for the day already i have already realized that in the end anything that i accomplish in life will not mean anything when i die everything that i did in my life will not matter anymore it might matter to the people that were entangled in my timeline but eventually they will figure out the same thing so it is fine they will stop caring as well wherever darkness manifests itself there is still light i still want to enjoy my life here on earth and in fact i do sometimes i still really care about the people close to me the feeling of love is what stops me from ending it i wish that i did not have to feel this way but i am still a human it pains me that some people care about me because they really should not if they knew how i felt i am sure it would pain them i wish others did not need to feel pain i know that this is definitely not normal but sometimes i feel that my goal is to save everyone from this inevitable suffering i doubt it will happen but some day i think that i would like to build some crazy powerful atomic bomb and destroy earth so us humans would no longer have to feel anything anymore i want to die but i do not want to die yet

1,first time writing my thoughts down observations that make me depressed 1 i feel like no one is like me 2 time ends all 3 shitty people own the world 4 life has no meaning unless you like lying to yourself 5 everyone is clueless including me 6 laughing is my only escape 7 love does not happen to everyone it should 8 nothing amazing ever happens 9 everyone has a demon they cannot escape 10 most people do not help only hate my observations 11 i got lucky with my life compared to most people and that bothers the fuck out of me 12 am i the only one that thinks this way i feel like a crazy person no one ever talks about this shit 13 critical thinking is rare should be standard in 2021 14 death sounds fun compared to living since its something no one knows about 15 i wish i did not exist yet i love who i am compared to everyone else 16 i lie to myself to feel better but it always fades at the end of the day i wrote this list for me but if it resonates with anyone else then that makes me slightly happy i have been alone with my thoughts of what this world i live in is about for so long and nothing makes sense i just want answers that no one has and it has been eating away at me for years everyone tells me to not think about it and just live your life i cannot these questions and observations that i always come back to is all i care about they are the only questions that need an answer who gives a fuck about what to have for lunch when you do not even know why you exist i would be fine if i lived in a utopia of magic and wonder but that is a fantasy that does not exist i am living in hell that others see as normal
1,phrases i am tired of hearing it gets better for fleeting moments at best you are loved by who lmao you who does not even know my name a stalker temporary problem well i guess this is techinally correct no one lives forever there is so much to live for well maybe for you that is true but for me who has lost almost all motivation and ability to feel happiness its not relatable what about your loved ones okay that is just guilt trippy and either way not everyone has loved onessupport systems just because you do janet just exercise and drink water omgthanks starstruck s what if something amazing and life changing happens that would not if you died yeah i have been carrying on that hope for years and here i am just put yourself out there i have tried so many times part of the issue in the first place is that it usually never goes anywhere and because of my mental health and abandonment issues people are usually driven away also i completely lack the ability to maintain long term relationships and have no idea what a healthy one is like in the first place of course that is all assuming i cannot get myself out of bed in the first place find the social skills i do not have and stop being an anxious little bitch god shut up i respect your religion but please shut the fuck up choose to be happy my ability to choose seems to be locked should i put it in rice turn it off and on go to therapy sure you paying seriously i understand and am thankful for even if it does not seem it the sentiment behind some of these but they are basically all built on assumptions or plain old ignorance also sorry if this type of post is overdone i needed to rant
1,just a sea of darkness i try so hard to see the positive things i try to focus on the sunlight and flowers or yummy food but lately the sunlight just burns the flowers are wilting and nothing tastes good everything is cardboard to a depressed soul i stopped my medication for several reasons so i knew it would come back hard but on top of that i have had to live in a greasy motel for a month with my husband daughter and two cats then move into our house which has cost us thousands then get ready to send my 2 year old to daycare for the first time while i go back to school right after finding out my husband is deploying for a year i am used to being a single mom at this point he is always gone but he is prioritizing his coworkers over his family right before he leaves and he knows my depression is horrible but he is only unkind to me angry unsympathetic what hurts the most is that last night someone struggling with depression called him and he talked to them for hours to help them through it but me me he shoves to the wayside with little concern he brushes me off as selfish overdramatic and more i do not have anyone to call i do not have anyone to talk me through it nobody cares enough no matter how much i struggle so i struggle through it silently and alone and every day i wonder if it will be the day i finally break i have endured so much pain sadness loss trauma abuse i do not know why i have kept going but lately every day seems meaningless i am just numb going through the motions of being a responsible and levelheaded adult all the while i am spinning out internally and i have nobody to turn to loneliness is my only friend
1,stockpile of meds cw suicide hi i have honestly been suicidal for like 20 years i am 30 now i cannot imagine a life where suicide is not an option i cannot imagine getting better i decided to be slightly more honest with my therapist and i am going to be going for partial hospitalization soon so due to having many mental illnesses i have been on a lot of meds some of which were on a trial basis and i have kept them all i have enough of one particular med to kill myself i am not currently on this med and it is not useful to me in any way besides killing myself i cannot imagine myself ever willingly getting rid of my stash i obviously have not told my care team i have it i have had it since 2014 when i stopped that particular med it will still work even though it is old like i feel like i need that out so whenif i get better do you think i would be willing to get rid of it honestly the thought of that is scary and makes me not want to get better i need the out i know there are other ways to go but this is the method i have chosen that i am most comfortable with for various reasons if i am honest with my care team and tell them about it and that i refuse to get rid of it even though there have been a few times this month i was seriously considering using it will i be stuck in a hospital until i commit to throwing my stash away i know that by having it here i am in danger i do not care i need it i mean i have had it for years without using it so i am pretty safe i think usually i am not even sure if it is possible for me to get better i cannot imagine a life without suicidal ideation i cannot imagine not needing an out what do you all think
1,i finally went to see a psychiatrist and he straight up told me i do not have a mental illness i am sorry if i sound mad and this is a rant i am fucking furious so after 3 months of waiting many years of putting all of this off i finally get to see a psychiatrist i drove 2 hours to get here spent 20 bucks on parking and i was told to fuck off this guy could barely speak english but all he talked about was how cannabis is bad and all my problems are from cannabis i have been smoking daily for 2 years now and ill admit it is a problem but i have literally been dealing with mental health issues my whole life he would not even let me speak and when i did he was just drawing on his notepad he would just tell me that it is cannabis and i need to go to rehab and once i stop smoking i will be fine bitch i am not fucking fine there were so many things i needed to talk about i literally think i have autism and when i brought it up he did not even acknowledge it i wanted to talk about anxiety issues and adhd and ptsd but apparently i have none of those and it is just cannabis my favourite part of the whole meeting was when he told me i just need a mom i literally responded with well no shit but my mom literally just died a few months ago so that is not really an option i am so fucking pissed my life is literally going to go no where and i am never going to get help so this is fucking fun edit thanks for all the support guys i have got another doctors appointment set up to see a new psychiatrist so that is cool please stop upvoting and commenting haha i never wanted to get this much attention and only wanted the 3 people that usually respond lol
1,stressed and feel like i do not have anyone to turn to i like my work i like what i do but i am also overwhelmed i have double the work of my coworkers because i am very good at my job but it is frustrating because i am a bit behind on the files about a week and a half behind now and continue to get more behind as more and more are assigned to me and then one of my coworkers was able to have a full hour person phone call because of the free time he has it is frustrating i am also in grad school and took 2 courses during summer so i just do not have the time to work ot and get caught up i also cry sometimes when i get overly stressed i also have a few diagnoses bipolar 2 adhd anxiety and borderline personality disorder which i am still in the process of finding the right mix of meds there was short period of time where i cried at least once a week the first time my boss had been around when i cried she made me feel like i was too weak to handle the job but continued to assign me files since then i have avoided crying when she is in the office i was talking to my bf tonight kept talking over me and would barely let me get a sentence out and when i raised my voice to tell him he was talking over me he diverted the conversation to me yelling at him instead of acknowledging he was talking over me he said he was not talking over me and then called me weak because i cry from work i cannot talk to my friends about it because my boss is part of the friend group so i do not want her to think i am still weak i have a tendency to change jobs every year and a half so i am not trying to do that again i just needed to vent thank you for reading

1,do you also feel like this totally neutral and absolutely bored with life feeling that nothing has real substance and colour hello folks i feel a certain way since years and i try to muffle it as hard as i can but it is getting impossible and i want to know if you feel like this too or what is it i have always found interest in quite everything and i have tried to do everything around me that i was actually able to psychologically or physically speaking but i cannot get invested in anything i do any activities that i do are short and if they go on for too long i get bored i force myself to do quite everythings i force myself to feel emotions like happiness when i get a gift or happiness when i win on games and the only emotions that are spontaneous and real from me are frustration and absolute void when i do not force myself to live emotions out of peer pressure i feel absolutely neutral and quite sad about life everything seems washed out and boring literally everything nothing stimulates me or give me a feeling of pleasure or joy nothing really interests me and i feel like i have done everything that i had to do in my life and i only see one option now that it is over i do not want to suicide even if sometimes i think about it i will not do it because i do not want to but it just feels like life is meaningless now and it is the only logical choice i got the checklist done everything else is purely boring and non stimulating so i do not really want to live anymore because literally everything that i do makes me suffer even writing this text because i feel like it is useless and boring is that just depression in a way

1,i am stressed about my upcoming birthday i am a soon to be 14m who was born on the 25 of march a few months back y parents began asking what i want for my birthday they offered hoodies even 100 bucks i declined because i felt like if i responded they would think i am some ahole child who expects something for his birthday hence i declined but the sooner my birthday is approaching the more stressed i get because a few days ago i finally realized what i wanted this thing costs 36 bucks but i need 50 bucks to purchase something that will help me gain this thing thing is i have already asked my mother if i could use my own money for this thing and she said something like no it is best to keep the cash for bad times etc referring to the recent pandemic another thing is that she has already lost one job due to the virus and my dad is not gaining much either we are stabl3 we have good amounts of resources and really everything is going just as it always has but the problem is i feel selfish i feel like they had already gotten something for me and if i ask for money they would have just already wasted it on something else they planned to give me i feel like i should have came up with what i wanted earlier before the pandemic and everything i feel anxious whenever i ask for something even though they want to give me something overall i feel like an idiot and a selfish person i cannot even tell whether or not i should tell them what i want or not i am just worried over this thing that i reckon i am overthinking if you could give me advise on what to do that would be appreciated thank you for reading

1,staying stressed i am so stressed more than normal i am still in the grieving process since july 2019 when my papaw died he was like my dad now fast fwd to now my grandma is selling her house because her dr stated she does not need to be living by herself i cannot live with her because i have my own family and my apt is not big enough for her and she would not be able to handle my kids all the time plus she is starting to get frail my grandma is super strong and looks 20 years younger than her age of 75 so she is going to live with my aunt in iowa and she is all i got my sister barely talks to me because of other choices and my medical condition epilepsy so i do not get to see my niece and nephew very often i do not speak to my mother stepfather if you want to call him that and my brother for other personal reasons so i feel like i am being left alone even though i have my 3 kids and fiance i see her everyday and talk to her everyday my kids get dropped off there after school and we go see her i feel like i am just losing her like i did papaw and then when she passes i am going to lose her again i am extremely sad yes i am depressive and on medication but medication cannot help block all emotions that are happening in short periods of time i cannot talk to a therapist face to face because they will not be back in the office till july and i cannot talk to them through zoom or on the phone because i need someone there to call me out when i try to hold things back plus before this i constantly stay stressed and my anxiety meds just put me to sleep i do not want to be this stressed out all the time just needed to talk
1,i have school tomorrow and i am so fucking tired i know this sounds like some edgy fake shitmix some fourteen year old has conjured up for the sake of attention but i am just so tired i have struggled with my mental health for the past year and a half now my thighs always have some sort of fresh cuts on them i feel like lead and i cannot seem to hold onto the small rays of happiness even if i wanted to and school is justso intimidating i told everyone i would get up and make lunches for my sister and i because since cooking is something i like i thought taking that initiative would help me get up in the mornings but now the aspect of everything going wrong and being too swamped with work makes my head heart and i feel like my hearts about to burst because even this small thing that could have been a reprieve from the cold dark and unmotivated pit i was in will just slip from my fingers like everything else i do not know how to be a teenager who is dealing with mental health and being around people who have no idea what it actually is like i know i sound like i am putting on some kind of noble woe is me kind of attitude by saying this because i am so edgy and quirky and for what for wanting to rip my guts out for saving money for my funeral for not being able to wash myself or keep up basic hygiene because it takes so much fucking effort and i am so tired of hearing the adults who have had nothing but success call suicidal people the scum of the earth or my father and mother if i have to call them that screaming at me for yet another flaw i did not notice existed until they pointed it out or the emo dipshits
1,can i be treated for depression without admitting i have suicidal thoughts to my doctor for the first time in my life i am looking to get professional help and i would like some advice based on other peoples experiences first my issue is that i do not want to admit i have suicidal thoughts to anyone not even the doctor i am visiting in case my parents request a copy of my medical information i also cannot go to therapy for it at the moment anyway and out of all other symptoms i feel least emotionally ready to talk about that one or the attempt i have made in the past my parents are for the most part homeopathic and i am listed as a dependent under their insurance plan i am both neglected and kept on a very tight leash if that makes sense eg only being taken to the dentist once my teeth were already heavily deteriorated i am no longer a minor but i still live with them and i cannot drive myself anywhere or maintain a job as i am mentally crippled nor do i have friends to help me my doctors visit is under the guise of fainting from frequent migraines which is true my parents are paying for it and fortunately they cannot tell the difference between a neurologist and a psychiatrist in case of a referral i am planning to bring up depression to the doctor at the same time and will use all personal parttime money to pay for whatever else but will diagnosis or treatment change if i omit important facts like suicide i want to quickly get better focus and leave this place i cannot afford be locked up by my parents i know next to nothing about going to the doctors so maybe none of this is a valid concern
